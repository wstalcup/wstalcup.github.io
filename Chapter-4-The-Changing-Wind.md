_The boy proved to be a box of questions, overflowing with curiosity. He probed on my history, my companion’s. When our answers were not forthcoming, he drifted to wider topics. It was odd, as if the boy was of two minds. He would ask of general knowledge of the kingdoms, then query me on esoteric historical fact. A particularly dull line of questions was interrupted when, without notice, he slunk off, undoing a cord tied as his belt. He returned later with the corpse of a hare strung at his waist. Deftly, he skinned and gutted it, offering to share it with us for supper. Weary of trail rations, we easily accepted his offer._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_ 

-----

Gasping for breath on the ground of the smithy, Sycamore determined that training to Speak did not meet his expectations. He had learned much over the past weeks of effort, but little of it had to do with manipulating the wind.

“A moment to catch your breath, Sycamore,” Rhubarb Aivis, Lupin’s father, said, “Then I need you on the bellows. Iron needs heat. Heat needs air.”

Sycamore grunted understanding between gasps, futilely wiping at the itchy black dust that covered his arms from breaking up charcoal that morning. As part of his instruction, Jackdaw insisted Sycamore train his body, master his breath. This had filled Sycamore’s days with menial work, usually at the service of one of his clansmen.

“Up, son. Time wastes.” Rhubarb said, grabbing Sycamore under the arm and pulling him to his feet. Like his son Lupin, Rhubarb was a robust man. He had wide shoulders and steady, sturdy hands. His brown hair had begun to thin in the back and his thick beard singed at the ends.

Sycamore exhaustedly took his place at the bellows, working some life into his sore arms to pump the huge things. He pulled heavily down, coaxing some heat into the forge. His shoulder creaked with the effort, and he scowled roughly. Across from him stood Lupin, serving as his father’s striker. Sycamore had expected grief from his oft-times tormentor, but he’d been largely silent since the morning. In the heat of the forge, it seems, there is little room for insults. 

“More heat,” Rhubarb said, his deep voice cutting through the hiss of the forge fire. Sycamore strove to fulfill the demand, leaning into the movement of the bellows with all the strength he could muster. Wind burst forth with great pressure, sending sparks dancing into the air, heating the forge and the metal placed within. There was likely a lesson within that movement of air regarding the nature of wind, but Sycamore was too exhausted to notice it. Long, agonizing moments passed as Rhubarb waited for the metal to come up to temperature. Sycamore was on the verge of begging for rest when the big man reached into a barrel behind him, grabbing a handful of sand and casting it upon the metal in the forge. 

“Lotus,” The big man called, grabbing a pair of heavy tongs and reaching into the forge to grab one of the two pieces of metal within. From behind him, the younger Aivis boy, Lotus, stepped up with his own pair of tongs, drawing out the other piece of metal. With practiced ease, father and son lined up on the anvil the two bits of metal, a bucket with a rust-hole and a disk of iron to patch it. Rhubarb tapped at where they overlapped with a small hammer, and Lupin quickly followed with a heavy swing from his sledgehammer. The smithy filled with the rhythmic crashes of hammer falls, alternating small and large. The sound and sight of it, sparks dancing off the slowly dimming metal under a thunder of crashing tools, mesmerized Sycamore.

A moment passed and Rhubarb thrust the partially fused pieces of metal back into the forge. “The bellows, Sycamore,” He boomed, “Don’t waste the heat.” Without a word, sycamore leaned into his task, mentally cursing himself for agreeing to his brother’s twisted understanding of training.

“The wind surrounds us, guides us,” Jackdaw said, “But also exists within us, as our breath. Focus on that connection. Your inhales, exhales, the same wind that cools on a warm day, pulls a stray leaf from a tree, calls forth a raging storm. Feel the energy of the wind, pulsing as you breathe.”

Sycamore made an effort to ignore the pangs of pain from muscles sore at the day’s work. He sought the flow of energy Jackdaw spoke of while distractedly rubbing at his pained neck. The pair were seated abreast on the same hilltop of Jackdaw’s earlier demonstration. It had become a meeting spot, where Sycamore’s elder brother tried vainly to instruct him on the fundamentals of Speaking with the Wind. The lessons felt fruitless to Sycamore, years of their mother’s nebulous sayings distilled to evenings of confusion.

“Can you feel the energy?” Jackdaw asked.

“I fear I feel little beyond the ache of weary muscles,” Sycamore said with irritation. Jackdaw sighed and turned to Sycamore, the focus of their lesson broken.

“The forge makes for a harsh mistress,” Jackdaw said. With a sudden smile, he added, “Perhaps we begin to understand the source of Lupin’s deficient personality, singed by the heat of the forge.” He giggled to himself. 

Since beginning his training, Sycamore had learned that his brother was a man of strange humor. He rapidly changed moods, from severity to comedy and back in the space of a few breaths. He had inherited much of their mother’s penchant for offering obtuse advice, but with his own eccentricities that made spending the evenings with him quite different than Sycamore had expected.

“Stretch for a moment, loosen your muscles,” Jackdaw said, serious again, “And we’ll resume our contemplation.”

Jackdaw had always been a figure to envy in Sycamore’s sight. He excelled where Sycamore was weak. He was strong, well liked. Still, Sycamore had never truly gotten to know him. By the time he was old enough to converse with his brother, Jackdaw had left as a journeyman, traditionally a time from ages seventeen to twenty when members of their clan visited another to learn a trade.

When he returned, it was with a surname, Lenos, and with news that he was to build his own home. Sycamore still did not know why his brother had left theirs, only knowing that he had done so at their mother’s insistence.
 
Without warning, Jackdaw slapped Sycamore heartily on the back, sending a shock of pain through his muscles and cutting off his retrospection.

“Stretch, brother. I did not give you this break to stare into nothingness. I’ll not have you deep in thought now only to fidget during the lesson.” Jackdaw again laughed to himself, finding some humor in his statement.

Some time later, the sun had set and the two brothers were making their way back to Sycamore’s home for dinner. Another change since the start of their lessons, Jackdaw often joined Sycamore and their mother for the evening meal.

“Jackdaw,” Sycamore began, tracing his earlier line of thought, “Why did you move out of our home when you returned from your apprenticeship?”

A long moment of silence passed, long enough that Sycamore began to wonder if Jackdaw had heard him. 

“How much do you know of our mother’s past?” Jackdaw asked suddenly.

Sycamore considered the unexpected question. His mother often told tales of her youth, usually of past mistakes, lessons learned. Occasionally she spoke of a city to the east, a cold temple of stone.

“Little, beyond what I know of the clan’s history,” Sycamore finally answered. “We came here about twenty years past, fleeing west from perpetual conflict.”

“True enough,” Jackdaw said with a nod. “Mother, back in the east, was a priestess at a temple to the wind. You know she swore off her surname long ago. This was part of her oaths. Bear no children, Bear no name, Bear no grudges. Because of this, when I became an adult, she asked me to move out, take my own name. I suspect she will ask the same of you when you reach adulthood.”

It had not occurred to Sycamore that he may be asked to follow his brother and move out when he became an adult, and the thought disturbed him.

“And mother, she sees no problem with this? She’s content with never having a family?”

Jackdaw looked at him with sad eyes. “She wept when she asked me to leave,” He said, “I believe she took me in on a favor to my birth mother. Once the favor was fulfilled, she sent me off to maintain her old oaths.”

Sycamore struggled to imagine his mother, pillar of stern discipline and control, weeping. A thought occurred to him.

“What of me, then?” Sycamore asked, “She never knew my parents, so why did she take me in?”

Jackdaw smiled at him. “Perhaps she saw the day in the future when I would leave and did not wish to return to solitude. Or perhaps she took pity on a babe, swaddled in mud instead of wool.” He let out a peal of laughter.

“I wish she would tell me more of that time, of her past. I’m more than curious about the history of our clan, but the adults seem to grow irritated whenever the subject comes about.”

“For the older members of our clan, your curiosity would bring dark memories. You know how I told you to avoid speaking of your training here?”

Sycamore nodded. He’d explained away his change in schedule to Trout and Pike as an effort to strengthen his body, avoiding any mention of Speaking with the Wind.

“If it was our Mother’s decision, our clan’s art of Speaking to the Wind would die with those memories. She has much greater strength in this art than I, but she reviles it. She taught me the skill as part of the favor to her friend. Your ability to heal, she sees as a thing of beauty, used to recover and bring peace. Speaking she views as an art of warmaking, only useful to bring pain and destroy.”

“Then you go against our mother by teaching me?” Sycamore asked. He could scarcely imagine defying their mother, especially if, as Jackdaw claimed, she was so powerful.

Jackdaw shook his head. “I pleaded with her to let me train you until she relented. Perhaps in a world of ideals, I would not feel it necessary. You are smart, talented in healing. Even without the ability to speak, you will find your place.”

“Then why teach me?”

“Because this is not a world of ideals. I listen to the wind, and I am afraid.” Their pace had slowed, his tone become uneasy.

“What do you hear?” Sycamore thought back to the night of the feast, unease in the north.

“Violence. Pain,” Jackdaw said, voice scarcely above a whisper, “Screams.”

-----

Days later, Sycamore again found himself wandering south of the village, weaving between rocky hills. As he walked, he dutifully practiced what Jackdaw taught him, feeling for the energy of the wind in his breath, in the world around him. He had felt it during their training several times now, but his eagerness betrayed him. When he reached for that energy to seize and channel it, he’d felt it scatter like grains of sand between his fingers.

He looked around him, seeking that hill, familiar from his dreams. Since that night of the hunt, the strange dreams had come back many times. A man to the south, the tallest hill a prison, fire and smoke. He told Jackdaw of the visions, hoping his brother had experienced something similar. Jackdaw did not comprehend the images, but encouraged Sycamore to follow his instincts, listen when the world speaks to him.

So he trekked south, once again. He’d spent the day tending flock with Trout and Pike, who endeavored to teach him how to properly use a shepherd’s crook – a lame excuse to whack each other with sticks. When their mother caught wind of their instructions, she’d sent Sycamore off to discipline her children. Time to spare before his lesson with Jackdaw, he searched for the tallest hill.

Around him, the wind rippled, and Sycamore felt for that thrum of power, his connection to the wind. In his mind, he pictured the flow of the wind, blowing at his back. It came from the north, through the Songwood, lifting birds wings, scattering wilted petals. Beyond that, it blew on the slopes of the Redrock Mountains, coaxing rocks to tumble down their steep walls. He felt it there, a whisper of energy. With his mind and his hand, he reached out, connecting to that flow of power. He felt himself unite with the wind, and a breath escaped his lips, joining in a northbound gust. Power flowed into him, twisting and turning through his limbs, a spring breeze. It was a trickle, barely there, but he felt the wind shift around his fingertips as he suggested change in the air. Greedily, he tried to seize more of that power, to, like his brother, call a windstorm around him. And, when he lost himself in his desire for power, so too did he lose his unity with the wind.

Sycamore breathed an exasperated sigh, frustrated that he failed to do much more than have the wind whimper around his fingers. Still, he felt a smile blooming on his lips. This was his first brush with success, his first sense of the potential for strength his brother saw in him. It was a good feeling.

His search led him quickly to the hill from his dreams, the location rooted in his mind from experience. He looked upon it from a distance, feeling that same peculiar sensation of longing. In his dreams, he had begun to notice things. To many of the visions, there was a sense of time, of memory. Like an old tale, he knew there had once stood a tower here, tall, strong. Now, it had crumbled to dust, scattered with flame and age. A man had once stood upon this hill, or a statue of one. At first, he had not noticed it, but the man, strangely, resembled Sycamore. He saw the man was tall, taller even than Pike and Trout. In that way he was different than Sycamore. But there was a frailness about his limbs, a narrowness to his shoulders all too familiar to Sycamore.

Sycamore began his approach to the hill. The man’s face, too, resembled Sycamore. Like Sycamore, he had small eyes, a narrow mouth. Like Sycamore, his ears pressed to the side of his head. Of course, there were stark differences as well. He had black hair like Sycamore, but where Sycamore’s hair was straight, the man’s hair curled. Where Sycamore’s skin was pale, the man’s was dark, like onyx.

At the bottom of the hill, he paused. The visions in his mind left him unsure. He knew he was different from his clan, had suffered through his differences. But this man from his dreams was familiar, different in the same ways as Sycamore. Were these memories of a father, a family, who shared in his peculiarities from birth? Or were they figments, creations of a mind greedy for acceptance. He had not told Jackdaw of the man’s features, fearing rebuke or laughter from his brother. 

In his dreams, he always awoke after setting foot on the hill, and now he stood, lingering before that step. He did not know what awaited after he stepped onto it, and his poise fled him. He feared that somehow, by stepping onto this hill, he would learn something to upset him. He feared, too, that he would step onto the hill and nothing would happen, the dreams, delusions created by a childish mind.

He took the first step, onto the base of the hill. Nothing. Several more steps up the slope, and Sycamore searched his awareness for something, a change, or a sense of understanding. Still, he felt nothing. He walked to the top of the hill, waiting for insight, but nothing came. Sitting down in a heap at the peak of the hill, he felt his face color with embarrassment. A delusion, then. Dreams, fabricating purpose and meaning out of his overactive imagination. Momentarily, he wallowed in his feelings of self-loathing, but something was off. Who was the man? Why did the dreams repeat so incessantly? Sycamore had no answers, but he knew these dreams were unlike any he’d ever experienced or heard of. 

Sycamore paced around the hill, scouring the rocky slopes for anything from his dreams. He recalled, suddenly, the image of a prison, a cold chamber inside the hill. There was solitude within, isolation, imprisonment. Sycamore pondered the images, searching for meaning. The images spoke of experience, as if the strange man with features so similar to Sycamore’s was trapped within the hill.

Slowly, with hesitation, sycamore reached a hand down, placing his palm on the ground. His mother was far more skilled with her Healer’s Touch, able to sense someone’s essence from a distance. His ability was crude by comparison, but he had practiced, once or twice with Pike and Trout. Usually, he could muster the feeling of something in the distance, though without context he’d be unable to call it a person’s essence.

Still, there was little to do but try. If this failed, he could do naught but take a spade and dig a hole in the hill to sate his curiosity. He sent a pulse of power through his hand, reaching with his Healer’s Touch into the hill. With a jolt, he recoiled, falling backwards. He frantically looked around, trying to make sense of what he had just felt.

Again, he used his Healer’s Touch to sense the hill, and again he felt shock at what he saw. His senses warred with understanding. Why did this hill pulse with essence like a person? Was such a thing possible?

Slowly, with hesitation, he reached out with his healing, connecting to the hill’s essence like he would when healing a wound. When he brushed against the core of the hill, the ground suddenly shifted below him. 

In a panic, Sycamore jumped to his feet, turning to flee. He ran for moments before gathering his wits and turning to look at the hill. He feared the hill would resolve to the statue from his dream. These fears were unfounded, and he saw the hill remained largely the same. Curiously, he saw a small cave had opened at the peak of the hill.

He swallowed his fear and again slowly walked up the slope. As he approached the new cave, images of his dream danced to the forefront of his mind. The hill, a prison; solitude in isolation; fear and longing. Sycamore feared that this was some sort of trap, a cage to snare the curious. But curious he was, and there was little to do but satisfy that curiosity. He approached the new opening, surprised to see that the hill had opened to no natural cave, but stairs.

Gathering his courage, he placed a foot on the first step of the cave, testing to see if the hill would try to close on his leg. When nothing changed, he took another step. A few more steps and he was enfolded in darkness. He squinted his eyes, trying to see though the blackness, cursing his lack of night vision compared to his clansmen.

He steadied himself on the wall of the stairwell, probing with his feet as he stepped through the cave. He shuddered at the thought that right now he was within the essence of the hill, fully at the whims of its control over itself. Dismissing these fears, he continued. He was to follow this to the end, no matter how reckless. 

A few more steps and Sycamore stumbled as the stairwell ended. It seemed to open to a chamber, but it was too dark for Sycamore to see. He stumbled blindly in the darkness, and fear assaulted him as he lost his sense of direction.

He took several deep breaths, centering himself. Again, he reached out with his Healer’s Touch, ignoring the overwhelming sense of being within another’s essence, and connected his power to the core of the hill.

Suddenly, around him, he heard whispers of a voice, speaking a language he did not know. He gasped, whirling around, searching for the source, but it seemed the voice echoed off all the walls at once.

The speaking continued, indecipherable to Sycamore, slowly growing in volume.

“Are you the voice of the wind?” Sycamore tried lamely, hoping it could understand him.

Suddenly the voice cut off. A moment later, it spoke again.

“Interesting. You speak the language of the Hillfolk, I would not have predicted. Welcome, boy, to my sanctum. We have much to discuss.”

Around Sycamore, four torches lit, blinding him with their light.
