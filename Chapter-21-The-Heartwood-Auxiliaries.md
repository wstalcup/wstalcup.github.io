_It was a common pattern for my companion and I to share stories over our meals. Usually, the boy listened with rapt attention, reacting and asking questions as well as any child being told a bedtime story. My favorite occasions, though, were when he spoke of himself. He would tell of the first time he left his village, the first time he killed an animal with his sling, or describe some event from his childhood. The stories were mostly mundane in nature, but they helped me to paint the picture of his life. I could never decide if the painting was one of joy or tragedy._

An Excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

The line for enlistment moved quickly, and after only a few moments of waiting, it was Sycamore’s turn. His hood was drawn tight over his head. After his experiences in the shantytown, he was not taking any chances at drawing extra attention.

_I can’t see a thing with your head buried in your cloak_, The Magus whined.

_We saw enough on our approach. It’s tents and mud, not much more._ Sycamore felt a huff from the Magus, but the man ceased his complaints. Through their contract, the Magus could see and hear everything Sycamore did. It was an odd thing to take in, and Sycamore did not quite understand the details, but already he had begun to adjust to the voice in his head knowing exactly what he focused on.

“Name and clan?” A familiar voice asked when Sycamore approached the roughly constructed desk. The man, seated on some kind of foldable chair, was hardly paying attention as he scribbled notes on the register in front of him.

Sycamore pulled his hood back, enough that his face was visible. “Sycamore, of the Heartwood clan,” He said. The man at the desk paused in his writing, eyes rising with a small frown. The last time Sycamore had seen Administrator Moss was when he received a scolding for trusting Mastiff. In truth, it was sound advice, though Sycamore still resented him for its bluntness.

“Finally, our young Westfolk friend shows his face,” the Administrator said dryly, “You very nearly missed our departure, you know. Many would have been disappointed.”

“Well, I’ve arrived now,” Sycamore said. With a new thought, he frowned. “Who asked after me? Besides the other Heartwood folk, of course.”

Administrator Moss smirked at him, tapping his pen on the desk as he listed each name, “General Marigold, commanding officer of this army, to inform me of your clan’s circumstances. Sister Quartz, commander of the Speaker Corps, asking to add a note to your assignment. Your friends, of course, to verify that you would be assigned to the same unit when you arrived. And one of my sergeants, asking after your placement, hoping he could command you.”

_I was not aware you had so many powerful connections,_ The Magus noted.

_Nor was I¬_. “Well, then, they’ll be happy to hear I’ve arrived. Where are my friends stationed? I assume I’m to join them.”

“Not quite,” Administrator Moss said. He flipped a few pages on his register, jotting a few lines when he found his place. “Per Sister Quartz’s request, you’ve been assigned as a member of the Speaker Corps.” He looked up at Sycamore, eyeing him levelly. “I heard about your business with the council, and I hope I don’t need to warn you that using Speaking to attack another member of the military is as good as going at them with a blade. You may have the attention of some high-ranking folk, but that just means it will be impossible to overlook any disciplinary infractions.” He raised an eyebrow. “Understood?”

Sycamore nodded mutely, swallowing. There would be no demonstrations to those who questioned his abilities, then. Not that he had planned on doing so; he imagined that few would drive him to frustration as well as Lode had.

Moss, noting Sycamore’s understanding, nodded once before continuing, “You’re to report to Sister Quartz immediately. She’ll inform you on any assignments before we depart. I doubt it will be an issue, but take care not to overindulge tonight. We’re to break camp at sunrise tomorrow, and it will hardly do to have our soldiers marching hungover.”

“Where is the Speaker Corps?” Sycamore asked. The administrator was already back in his notes, writing quickly as he did calculations with his fingers.

“Find the center of the camp, where the officers’ tents are pitched,” Moss said without looking up, “The Speakers should be around. Look for folk who turn their noses up at common soldiers.”

------

Sycamore found the others as they were eating dinner. He had finally managed to untangle himself from the Speaker Corps’ questions and accusations when the evening bell had rung. Fearing to suffer a meal with them, he’d made a hasty retreat, disappearing into the sea of tents.

“I had started to worry you wouldn’t make it,” Pike said as he handed Sycamore a bowl of stew. With a grateful nod, Sycamore took to the food with gusto. They were seated in a circle of around ten soldiers, and Sycamore was surprised by how many he recognized.

“Why did you not arrive with the others?” Perch asked. He had not seen her since their arrival to Whitebrook, and she looked much healthier than when she’d left them.

“He had some errand to run,” Lupin said as he stretched his neck, “Though I have begun to believe that he simply wished to miss Marrow’s drills.”

“That’s Sergeant Marrow, boy,” The old man growled, “Besides, the Speaker Corps doesn’t drill, so our boy here would not have had the pleasure of my instruction.” With his military history, he had been assigned a command in the army. Somehow he’d gotten the assumption that Sycamore and the others would be joining up, so he had put a note in for them to come in under him.

“What are they like, anyway?” Juniper asked, “When we saw the note for your assignment, I wanted to ask my aunt, but she’s been too busy.” She had a quiver of arrows in front of her, and she was checking the fletching and straightness of each.

Sycamore searched for a description of his afternoon with the Speakers Corps. “They are… Difficult,” He finally settled on, “There was hesitance, among them, to recognize my ability.”

_You understate the matter_, The Magus sent. Sycamore ignored him, not wishing to worry his friends.

“Because you’re Westfolk?” Pike asked with a frown.

Sycamore shook his head, “No, surprisingly, I don’t believe that was the reason. Rather, I think they did not wish to recognize that someone as young as I, from an unknown village, was capable of what they deem to be a sacred art.” At first, they had outright denied that he could possibly be a member of their corps. Sister Quartz had silenced their complaints, but the way they still looked at him, he doubted they were satisfied.

“Well, if they don’t want you, you’re welcome to join our squad,” Pike said. He looked to their commanding officer for approval, “Right, Sergeant?”

Marrow stared at Sycamore for a long moment, and he felt himself swallowing. He hadn’t forgotten the old man’s cold attitude towards Westfolk.

Finally, Marrow nodded, “Sure, you’re welcome, though only if it won’t rub the higher-ups the wrong way. I’m a simple sergeant, your high priestess will burn me alive.”

Sycamore smiled. “Thank you, but I think I’ll continue with the Speakers. I’ve never really had a chance to talk to one, aside from my mother and brother, and this might be a good opportunity to learn something new.”

“It’s a war, boy, not a classroom,” Granite said with a frown. He’d remained mostly silent since Sycamore’s arrival, though he was not sure if it was because of some lingering awkwardness from their last departure or something else.

Sycamore frowned but nodded. “Of course,” He said diplomatically. Pushing past the awkwardness, he turned to Pike and asked, “Do the others here know about our plan to split off from the army?” He wasn’t sure of the specifics, but considering Lady Marigold was the one who had made the suggestion, he doubted there would be any issue.

Perch spoke up, answering the question, “Four days north then you’re to head west.”

“We’re signed on as auxiliaries,” Pike added, “Not regular soldiers.”

“To think, I’ve spent all that time drilling you only for you to waste it on a fool’s errand,” Marrow muttered.

“Call us fools, but our mission is no waste,” Said Lupin with a wild grin, “We’re going to bite back at the Fireglass.”

“Then it’s a good thing I’ve taught you how to use your teeth,” Marrow said, grabbing the sword sheathed next to him.

“That reminds me, Sprout,” Pike asked, “Were you able to succeed in your desperate plan? Did you get the power you wanted?”

Sycamore looked to Pike, felt an uneasy smile rise to his face. He grabbed at the Soul Stone hanging under his shirt, thinking back to his discussions with the Magus. Finally, he nodded, “I got something. I just hope it’s enough.”

------

When the sun set and preparation for lights-out began, Sycamore reluctantly left the company of Marrow’s squad, making his way back to the Speakers’ tents. He’d been uneasy when he learned his assignment was different from the others, and those feelings were doubled after spending the evening with them.

_Your friends have changed since I last saw them. They’ve grown,_ The Magus sent. Sycamore recalled when they had hid in his library after the attack on the village. It felt like an eternity had passed, but in reality it had not even been a month.

¬_We have a purpose now._ They’d been listless, then, still shaking from the shock of their world being torn from them. Now, finally, they had a destination in sight. 

As he approached the Speakers’ tents, he saw a bustle of activity. He tried to avoid notice, but he heard a voice call his name, and he turned to see Lady Marigold coming towards him.

“Sycamore,” She said, “I’ve been searching for you. No one seemed to know where you went.” She was dressed in practical military clothing, and her hair, normally a collection of braids, was up in a single, tight bun. The look suited her.

“I took dinner with the other Heartwood folk,” He said simply. It was a surprise to hear she was looking for him, but he trusted her to explain quickly enough.

She smacked her forehead lightly. “Of course, I should have thought of that. Walk with me.” She turned and took off at a quick pace, and Sycamore followed close behind her. “You should tell someone if you’re going somewhere, by the way. Formally, as a member of the Speakers Corps, you’re an officer, so someone should always know where you are.”

“Right,” Sycamore said, vaguely recalling one of the other Speakers using that information in protest to his position in the corps. “What do you need me for, Lady Marigold?” He paused, “Or should that be General Marigold?”

“Call me what you will. I need your healing. One of our officers, a young lieutenant, fell off his horse and broke his leg. Usually, I would let him suffer the consequences of his mistake, but his father is an old friend, and he’s expecting the world out of his boy. I’d rather not send him home before we even set out.”

Sycamore hummed his understanding. More than once Pike and Trout had begged him to heal their injuries so they wouldn’t have to explain how they got hurt to their parents. It was a common enough story, though he expected better out of military officers.

After a moment of walking they came to a large, red tent. Lady Marigold pushed open the tent flap, and Sycamore stepped in behind her. The inside was wide, with an array of animal hides spread across the ground. The air smelled of oil lamps and some roasted meat. A young man lay sprawled on a cot moaning in pain, a half-eaten plate of food next to him. One of his trousers’ legs was pulled up to his thigh, revealing a thickly swollen area under his knee. 

After Sycamore studied him for a moment, Lady Marigold spoke, “Can you heal him? I know it’s a major injury, but I hoped…” Her voice trailed off.

Sycamore nodded, “It should be fine, unless he’s injured in some larger way I can’t see.”

Lady Marigold nodded gratefully. She approached the man, explaining in a few short sentences what Sycamore was about to do. Following behind her, Sycamore knelt down next to the cot. He poked at the swollen part of the leg, earning a groan of protest and some slurred curses. The bone seemed to be its correct position, and Sycamore reached out with his Healer’s Touch.

The man’s soul was there, and Sycamore easily plucked at one of its tendrils, effortlessly pulling the energy through his body to his broken bone. Frowning slightly, Sycamore watched as the wound quickly repaired itself and the swelling fell. The man yelped at the sensation, then sighed when the pain from his leg faded.

Sycamore frowned at the newly healed wound for another moment before turning to Lady Marigold. She was staring at him with wide eyes, an unsure expression on her face.

“Is something wrong?” Sycamore asked as he rose to his feet.

“It’s –” She started. She paused to collect her thoughts. “I was just thinking, it’s a shame you have to leave so soon. That’s an invaluable asset you’ve got there.”

Sycamore laughed awkwardly, unsure of whether to be pleased by the praise or put off by the calculations he saw in her eyes.

The man, now sitting up on the cot, spoke in earnest tones, “Thank you, sir, thank you. How can I repay you?”

Sycamore glanced at him, shrugging. “Don’t fret over it. Just be more careful next time, I’d not like to make a pattern of healing you.”

“Of course! More careful! Thank you,” He said with an eager nod. Waving off the man’s continued thanks, Sycamore and Marigold left the tent. She was still staring at him with those evaluating eyes.

“If that’s it,” Sycamore started when they emerged from the tent, “I should probably get some sleep. I’ve been travelling for a long while, and I understand we have to break camp early tomorrow.”

“Hmm?” Lady Marigold asked, blinking a few times as reality returned to her, “Of course, yes. Good night Sycamore, and thank you for this. Whether you accept it or not, I’m in your debt.”

Sycamore shook his head dismissively, “Consider it a part of repaying you and Lady Opal for taking care of us. A favor for a friend.”

“A favor for a friend,” She muttered as she walked off, waving him goodnight. Sycamore frowned at her back, wondering what sort of calculations were going through her head.

_Be careful of that one,_ The Magus sent, _She seems intelligent._

_I know,_ Sycamore replied, _Though so far she’s proven to be nothing but a capable ally._ He recalled something odd from the healing. _Magus, to heal that fracture, it was too easy. I consider myself quite capable at healing, and most injuries are not beyond my reach, but that was effortless. It felt no different than breathing._

_And this is a change?_

_It’s the first time I’ve healed someone in weeks_

_A side effect, perhaps, of our contract. It could be that some of my strength in soul magic was transferred to you along with the bit of my soul, or perhaps being exposed to the magic of the contract strengthened you._

With a nod, Sycamore went in search of his tent. He was uneasy to notice such an obvious change, but there was little to be done besides adapt and move on.

------

Sycamore drowsily pulled his clothes on as the sun rose. They were the fine, tailored set that Lady Opal had given him, a nice change from his ragged travel clothes. He bound his hair in a tight tail. It had grown longer than he liked it, nearly to his shoulders. He looked himself over once more, patting out any obvious wrinkles in his sleeves, and stepped out into the morning light.

The camp was awake with activity. He heard shouted orders and complaints around him as the army went through the process of disassembling the camp they’d spent the last two weeks living in. He saw quartermasters barking at recruits as they tried and failed to bundle their tents tight enough for approval. The Speakers had attendants who handled their tents, and as soon as Sycamore stepped out from his, one got to work taking down the oversized thing. He appreciated the convenience, but was not quite sure of how to feel about being one of the few who had no work to do.

He arrived at their meeting place to find only two others waiting for him. They had not agreed on an exact meeting time, but he was surprised to see so few. He nodded a greeting to the other two, but they ignored him. He sighed at their coldness, wishing he could be disassembling a tent with Pike.

_How do you plan to cope with their attitude?_ The Magus asked.

_Silence and Boredom,_ Sycamore sent in reply. It would only be for a few days. In truth, this business in the army was a distraction before their true mission.

Long minutes passed as Sycamore waited, observing the work going on around him. More than once he was tempted to approach one of the attendants and ask to help, but he refrained. He knew that anything he did would only bring unwanted attention.

The other corps members slowly gathered in a group. Occasionally, they shot him dirty looks, but he stood far enough away that he could not hear whatever comments they made. With an inward laugh, he noticed more than one joined them with red eyes and a hungover stumble. Apparently they had not heeded the warnings of an early morning.

“Speaker Sycamore,” A voice said, approaching him from behind. He turned to see Sister Quartz stepping towards him. She had traded her normal pure white outfit for a more sensible green cloak over brown, rustic travelling clothes. Sycamore could hardly recognize her but for her serene expression. At a glance, she looked more like one of the farmer’s wives from his village than a high priestess.

“Sister Quartz, good morning,” Sycamore said with a respectful nod. His opinion of the woman was yet undecided. She had treated him with hostility on the council, but compared to the other speakers she was downright polite.

“Is there anything to be done? I grow restless standing around like this,” Sycamore asked.

She studied him for a short moment before replying, “You know, you could talk to the other Speakers.”

He glanced at the rest of the corps. They were huddled in a loose group, and those who had noticed him speaking to Sister Quartz frowned unhappily towards them.

“I believe it will be most comfortable for all of us if I keep my distance,” Sycamore replied with a tight smile.

Her eyes flicked to the group of judgmental onlookers and back before she replied. “Fair enough,” She said, “In truth, we have little in the way of work to do this morning. Normally, officers oversee the organization of their command, but the Speaker Corps is an independent unit, so we’re free from such responsibilities. Most consider it a privilege.”

He frowned. “Would it be alright if I practice my speaking, then? I swear I won’t direct it at any of our comrades – your demonstration in the council room was more than enough warning.”

A beat passed before she nodded slightly. “I admire your dedication to the craft. Go ahead and practice, but keep it subtle enough that I won’t hear any complaints from the other officers. You’ve enough of a reputation without causing trouble,” With a slight wave, she left him, approaching the rest of the corps.

Sycamore shook his head, wondering how it had come to the point where he had a reputation among an army’s officers. He discarded the thought, taking a deep breath as he searched for the pulse of the wind. In an instant he found it, the breeze brushing his hair, wicking beads of sweat from his forehead. With a now-instinctual exertion of will, he made the connection and began swirling the wind slowly around him in slight circles. He’d grown considerably in strength with his speaking recently, likely from his endless practice on the road.

A thought occurred to him. _Is there any chance that my Speaking was strengthened, somehow by our contract?_ With the difference in how healing felt and the way his speaking had grown over the past several days, perhaps there was some connection.

_You ask a question that soul mages have debated for centuries, over the relationship between soul magic and other forms. Normally, soul magic is learned after more traditional forms, so it becomes difficult to measure how strength is affected. However, now that you mention it, you did learn a form of soul magic first, so it provides an interesting avenue of research, maybe we can-_

_Boil it down, please,_ Sycamore snapped, cutting off his rambling.

_Perhaps. I cannot say for certain, but if you feel stronger, that’s as much evidence as I need to see a connection._

Sycamore nodded his understanding. With small movements of his fingers, he focused on precise, specific movements of the air, struggling to narrow the flow. It was extremely difficult – wind wanted to move chaotically, to try to bring order was to upset its nature. Still, his grasp on the delicate movements was improving. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a pair of leaves drifting from a tree. With a stroke of inspiration, he split his focus in two and grabbed hold of the leaves with the wind, guiding them in fanciful loops and wide swirls. He felt his hold on the wind straining at the effort of maintaining the dual flows, and as he brought the leaves closer and the need for precision grew, his head began to ache from exertion. Finally, he snatched the two leaves out of the air. He stared down at them for a moment with a smile before releasing them and watching as they fluttered slowly to the ground.

------

“Good Morning, people of Rocky Ford, army of Whitebrook,” The man called, standing on his podium. Sycamore stood near the head of a crowd, and he found it difficult not to constantly look over his shoulder at the mass of people. The army was lined in the central square of Rocky Ford, organized rows of soldiers dozens deep. To have so many standing behind him made his neck itch. The army was more than twice the size of Sycamore’s clan, and with the onlooking people of Rocky Ford, the crowd was easily over two thousand people. It boggled Sycamore’s mind to have so many in such a small location.

“My name is Zephyr, and I am the head of the Whitebrook clan,” The man continued. Sycamore recognized him from the council meeting as the person who sat central, next to Sister Quartz. He stood atop a podium besides Lady Marigold. His hair was in four short braids, and he wore a black shirt lined with gold thread at the collar. He stood tall and straight, with a confidence and presence that reminded Sycamore of his mother.

“We sent up the call for men and women to come here and join us in our goal of pushing back against a great evil. For too long now have the fiends of the Fireglass clan run rampant on our countryside, burning and destroying the comfort and peace of our lives.” There were angry mutters around Sycamore as the crowd was drawn into the speech. “Houses have been burned, families and friends, killed or taken. Enough is enough, and it is time for us to fight back.” He paused as a few men and women, soldiers mostly, let out cheers. “The call for justice went up, and you have answered. With the fire of righteous fury, you are our sword of justice. And now, I hand that sword off to our most trusted general, who stands beside me. General Marigold?” More cheers and a few loud whistles as Lady Marigold stepped up wearing a confident smile.

As the cheers calmed, she spoke, “Actions, in my mind, are far more important than words. I’ll not bore you with a long explanation of my goals or my experience, what qualifies me to lead you into the chaos of battle. Instead I ask for two simple things. Give me your trust, and give me your skills. Do these two things and I swear to you we will send the Fireglass fleeing in fright, regretting the day they decided to encroach on our lands and endanger our people.” There was a roar after this, and Sycamore felt himself letting out a whoop of excitement, caught in the fervor of her speech.

“Thank you, General Marigold,” Zephyr said, stepping back forward, “I wish you luck in your campaign. May the the wind strengthen you, the sun illuminate your path, and the stars guide you home.”

There was a final cheer, and marching orders went up. In short order, the army marched slowly out of the village as the residents yelled calls for luck, tossing sweets and flowers at passing soldiers as they left the village, cheering and yelling taunts to the fireglass.
