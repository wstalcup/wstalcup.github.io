_We walked through many of the skeletons of the Kingdoms’ eastward efforts. Old villages and outposts, dead from neglect or assault. Each of them told a story, and my eye was trained to discern it. The remnants spoke to me of fire or abandonment, and I connected these tales into a narrative of the downfall of human vanity. It was a bleak picture, but never bleaker than when the boy spotted some old bones tied to an oak post in the center of the village. He read the words under the display in a neutral voice: “Here hangs a heretic, his name discarded with his crimes. To taint the soul is to taint us all, and for his crimes he paid the price.” The boy paused to stare at the picture of Kingdom justice for a long while before we continued._

A smile naturally found itself to Sycamore’s face as he returned to their shack. After healing Cottonmouth he’d followed a chain of requests across the shantytown. His leather pouch hung heavily at his waist, full of copper coins. It still made him mildly uncomfortable to take money for his work, but he only asked for as much as his patients were willing to pay. In his mind this relieved some of the discomfort he felt at the transactions, though his mother would probably still give him a swift smack on the head if she heard about it.

When he stepped into their shanty, Lupin and Pike were seated across from each other, playing a game of dexterity. One was the leader and the other had to react to their movements or be slapped on the hand. It was a common enough game from their childhood, and Sycamore was dreadful at it. They paused when he entered, looking up at him.

“It’s late,” Pike said, “I was starting to worry.”

Sycamore pulled the coin-laden pouch from his waist, tossing it to Pike. “I think I may have found a way for us to enter the city.”

Pike opened the pouch, spilling coins into his hand. His eyes widened.

“How’d you manage this?” Lupin asked, snagging a coin from Pike and examining it more closely. The coins were uneven little disks of copper, stamped on one side with the Whitebrook clan’s symbol, a waterfall. The other side was stamped with a boar, a common symbol of strength among the Hillfolk.

“Some folk needed healing, and insisted on paying me when I obliged,” Sycamore said with a grin.

“All this from one injury?” Pike asked as he refilled the pouch and tossed it back to Sycamore.

He snatched the bag out of the air and fastened it back on his waist. “Not just one. Many are injured, from the road or from raids. If you look around you’ll see most people walk with a limp or have some bandaged up wound.”

Pike nodded slowly. “Of course. We’re healthy because you’re here, but most people don’t have a healer around, do they?”

“As far as I can tell, healers are as rare as Westfolk around here,” Sycamore said.

“You always were an uncommon sort, Sprout.”

“I’m just mad we didn’t think of this sooner,” Lupin said, flicking the coin in his hand and catching it, “So what, you earn us enough money to get into the city?”

“Then all that remains is to convince their council to give us the aid we need,” Pike said with a sigh.

“It’s a step forward,” Sycamore said, “A step towards an army.”

“A step towards revenge,” Lupin said with a wicked grin.

Over the next three days, Sycamore slipped into a routine of healing, eating, and sleeping. The others spent their time away from the depressing atmosphere of the shantytown, wandering and foraging in the nearby hills and woods. Sycamore was too busy to join them. It was a blur of injuries, from minor cuts and scrapes to wounds that would claim the patient’s life in a day if left untreated. Sycamore had never done so much healing, and he had not realized just how much the process drained him. He ended each day with a splitting headache, energy wrung out of him like an old wet rag. Thankfully, he awoke the next day hale enough to heal more people. 

Few injuries were as bad as Cottonmouth’s necrotic leg, but each wound carried with it a story, and after days of healing, Sycamore had a clearer picture of the devastation the Fireglass had caused throughout the western realm of the Hillfolk in the past months. A pattern emerged of the clan from the north taking prisoners in rapid raids for some unknown end. The Heartwood were hit with a larger force than most, perhaps because of the clans’ shared history, but few villages seemed to be unaffected by the Fireglass aggressions.

At first, many were skeptical to receive healing from “a Westfolk brat,” but after the first day, his reputation had spread enough that most treated him without bias. People still muttered curses and spat jeers, but when bones mended and cuts sealed, those words faded to gratefulness.

By the third afternoon of healing, Sycamore had earned almost enough money for them to pay admission to the city. It was twenty copper cents to a silver mark. As there were seven people in Sycamore’s group, admission to the city would cost a hefty sum of coins. Of course, not all of it could fit in his purse. He tucked much of the money away in his pack, so they agreed to always leave someone in the shacks to watch over their possessions. They were quickly approaching the required sum, and it would not do to have their progress undercut by carelessness and thievery. As it were, Sycamore felt increasingly anxious to be out of the smelly, muddy shantytown and into the city proper.

“A thousand thanks,” the man said, rubbing at his jaw. Next to him, his wife grinned a shaky smile as she pressed a handful of coins into Sycamore’s grasp.

“You’re very welcome,” Sycamore said, wincing at the building throb of pain in his head. This was perhaps the twenty-fifth person he had healed that day, a man with a jaw broken in some alcohol-fueled brawl. “I recommend avoiding any kind of violence for the coming weeks. The bone is weak when recently healed.”

“Of course, of course,” the man said with a lopsided grin, “The wine got the better of me before, but I’d rather not go through that pain again.”

“I’ll keep him sober and safe,” his wife said with a fierce look towards her husband. The genuine happiness on their faces brought a feeling of warmth to Sycamore that was almost addicting. Even without the money, Sycamore would have found it difficult to turn down folk in need, especially with how thankful his patients were.

With a smile and a nod, Sycamore excused himself, drawing his hood up and pushing out the shack through their ceaseless grateful words. He hoped the man would stay true to his word and avoid drunken fights, but what he had seen of the Shantytown planted a seed of doubt in his gut.

The rickety huts and muddy ground were ruled by the darkest emotions. Haunted memories and uncertain futures dominated people’s minds, and where despair ended, anger began. Violence was rampant among the refugees, and Sycamore often found himself toeing around folk brawling in the mud. There was little security, and the lawkeepers of Whitebrook had almost no presence outside the limits of the city. It was such that every third injury Sycamore healed was not a result of a Fireglass raid or an accident while travelling, but some broken bone from the hands of other refugees.

As he tramped through the mud back to their huts, Sycamore did some mental accounting. Arithmetic was not one of his strengths, but with the help of his fingers he could figure the math quick enough. With the money he earned today and what Mrs. Maple had left over of her own money, they should have more than enough to pay for their entrance into the city. He felt a surge of relief and anticipation. One step closer to getting help for their clan.

“Hey, you. Boy, with the hood,” A nasally voice called out, interrupting Sycamore’s calculations. Sycamore took a glance around. He was nearly alone on the path he walked, and he was the only one who had his hood drawn considering the clear evening weather. Certainly the voice addressed him.

He turned to the voice, studying the man who had called out to him. He sat astride a log with a rusted flask in his hand. His hair was in a tangle, and his face and clothes were caked in grime and mud. His nose hooked to the right from an old break, and with the filth it was impossible to place how old he was.

“Yes?” Sycamore asked hesitantly. Considering the flask in the man’s hand and the slur of his words, Sycamore feared he was some drunk looking for a scapegoat to take his anger out on.

“You wouldn’t happen to be that healer boy, would you?” The man said, a yellow-toothed smile coming to his face. “A fellow of mine could use your help, you know, and he’d pay coin for your time.”

Sycamore breathed a sigh of relief. Just someone else who needed healing. He was about to tell the man to lead the way when it occurred to him that he didn’t actually need the money – by his calculations they had enough to pay the fee into the city already, and he was starting to worry after his own health from the repeated healings. He carefully examined his soul every day to look for signs of strain or weakness, but he was not enough of an expert to see every detail.

Still, even after getting into the city, they would need money for lodging and food, so any coin he could gather would be welcome. Besides, if the man’s friend needed help, it was all Sycamore could do to provide it.

“If your fellow needs help, I’d be happy to do what I can,” Sycamore said.

“Right then,” The man said, taking a swig from his flask as he rose to his feet. He took a stumbling first two steps before his drunken balance took over, and he gestured for Sycamore to follow after him.

The man spoke as he led Sycamore along. “We’ve heard much about you,” He said, “I didn’t believe it at first, a Westfolk boy wandering the shanties fixing people up for not more than a bit of coin.” He threw a glance over his shoulder at Sycamore, his eyes glinting in the light of a nearby torch, “I bet you’ve made it pretty, what with the number of fools walking around half-dead.”

Sycamore chuckled awkwardly before replying, “That I can bring people back to health is as important as the coin, I think.”

“Oh, don’t mind me, young master,” The man said, “I don’t mean to question your character. By the wind and the sea, I know the value of a few coins, especially in times like these. Don’t mind me. Just an old drunk running his mouth.”

Sycamore hummed noncommittally, slightly off-put by the man’s slurred ramblings. Still, it was folly to read too far into a drunk man’s words, and he had few options beyond following the man or leaving a man unhealed. After all he pain he’d seen over the past days, Sycamore’s conscious would haunt him if he didn’t at least try to help.

They wove through the muddy paths for several long minutes before they paused in front of a particularly large hut. In front was a group of rough-looking men huddled around a table, dicing over cups of some alcohol. They looked up at Sycamore with cold eyes as he approached.

“Don’t mind them,” Sycamore’s escort assured, “Just some fellows caught in drink. Come in here, then, my man is right inside.” Sycamore nodded, hurrying past the men as they stared at him, and pushing inside the door of the shack.

Sycamore’s nose stung at the thick stench of the air, the alcoholic bite of spirits mixed with the sour smell of body odor and the smoky scent of cooked meat. A pair of men sat on either side of a cookfire, roasting a pair of rodents on a spit. 

One of the men looked much like Sycamore’s drunken escort, but the other was much more distinctive. One side of his head was shaven, and dark tattooed lines looped around his ear. It was not the first time Sycamore had seen tattoos, as some of the older members of Sycamore’s clan had them. They were common among career military folk, and from the size of this man, he looked the part. 

“Is this the healer brat, then?” The tattooed man said, looking over Sycamore with a piercing gaze. The edges of his mouth hooked up in a mockery of a grin that made Sycamore want to grab at his coin purse to make sure it was still there.

“Brought ‘em like you said, Mastiff,” Sycamore’s escort said.

“And you’ll get your due, should he prove as helpful as I hope.”

“I’m the healer, yes,” Sycamore said, pulling his hood off his head, “Your man here told me that someone needs healing. Would that be you?”

“So he’s really a Westfolk boy,” Mastiff said, “I wouldn’t have guessed.”

“I told you my information was good,” said the other man at the fire.

Impatience tugged at Sycamore, unease at the way they spoke, “I came here because I heard someone needs healing. Is it true or not?” The stench of the room fed Sycamore’s headache, the stuffy, smoky air adding to the throbbing pain.

“Yes, I was just getting to that,” Mastiff said as he and the other rose to their feet. He strode leisurely towards Sycamore. The smoothness of his step, the calmness in his voice tugged at Sycamore’s instincts. He didn’t seem to be injured in any way. “They say that you can heal anything, pup, even bringing people from the brink of death.”

“An exaggeration,” Sycamore said, “but the details are difficult, so it’ll be easier if you just show me what needs healing.”

“Right, right,” Mastiff said with a lazy smile, “What about this, then?” He held up a hand, revealing that two of his fingers had been severed just before the first knuckle. They were old wounds, long since scarred over.

Sycamore looked at the wounds for an instant before shaking his head with a frown. “I’m sorry,” He said, “I can’t heal anything missing from the body. A broken or crushed finger I could mend, but as soon as it’s been cut off, there’s nothing I can do.” Not that he had ever tried, but the conventional wisdom taught by his mother said as much.

“Now step back a moment,” Mastiff said, his brow furrowing but still wearing that half-smile, “I heard you were the savior of the shanties, capable of healing any wound short of death.” He turned to the other man, “Isn’t that what you heard?”

“I head the same, and my information’s good.”

Mastiff flicked a thumb at his friend. “He says his information’s good. So tell me again, why can’t you heal something as little as a pair of lopped off fingers? Do you think you’re too good to heal someone like me?”

Sycamore swallowed, feeling a sudden need to be out of the stuffy shack as soon as possible. He took a hesitant step backwards, frowning when his shoulder bumped into the drunk who had brought him. “I’m sorry, but whoever told you that much was mistaken about the extent of my ability,” He tried to force an apologetic smile, but could only muster a grimace, “I can’t heal your fingers. Now, please excuse me.” He made to spin around and rush out of the shack, but was caught in his tracks when Mastiff’s three-fingered hand fell heavily on his shoulder, gripping tightly and holding him in place.

“Wait just a moment. You can’t dash my hopes and then just prance out of here like nothing’s wrong. I’ve been excitedly waiting to meet you, looking forward to having my fingers back. You’ve taken that joy from me, I think you owe me something in return.” With his free hand, Mastiff tapped at his chin for a moment, feigning thought. “Ah! I’ve got it. Give me your coin.”

Sycamore scowled at his captor, cursing his own naïveté. He had seen the crime and violence of the shantytown, why had he not recognized the threat it posed to him? Why had he ignored his instincts about the drunk, about the men perched outside the shack? A hundred curses for his own stupidity boiled in his mind, and a hundred more for these men who would rob him. His head ached and swam so much so that he could not feel the pulse of the wind’s power. He had a knife at his waist, but feared the cost of escalating things, feared his own clumsy hands on a blade. With no options, he was left at the mercy of these men, defenseless and alone. He had dug himself into a pit with his own foolishness, and there was little to do besides grit his teeth and try to climb out.

“Ten cents,” Sycamore said, reaching into his coin purse and pulling the copper coins from it.

“What’s that?” Mastiff said, his smile widening slightly.

“I’ll give you ten cents to let me be,” Sycamore said with a huff. He would pay the men, but he wouldn’t pretend to be happy about it. He held out a hand, offering the ten copper disks to the man.

Mastiff’s eyes glanced down to Sycamore’s outstretched hand. With a nod, he took the coins from Sycamore, sliding them into his own purse.

“There’s a smart lad,” Mastiff said, releasing Sycamore’s shoulder. Sycamore let out a tense sigh. It hurt to give these scoundrels some of their desperately needed money, but ten coins was a manageable price to pay

Sycamore’s eyes flicked around the room. “I’ll be going then,” He said with a stiff nod.

The punch caught him across the jaw before he had a chance to react. Lights exploded across his vision and pain exploded across his face. He stumbled backwards only to be caught by his escort, who looped his arms around Sycamore’s, holding him firmly in place.

“I don’t believe I said you could leave,” Mastiff said as Sycamore struggled to regain his composure. The half-smile on his face had resolved into an angry sneer. Sycamore shook his head, vainly trying to banish the daze from the punch and trying to pull himself from the drunk’s grip.

“We’ve seen you prancing about this pit of muck and scum, taking coin from saps with cuts and bruises, and you offer me ten cents? Do you think me daft?” The second punch slammed into his stomach, sending Sycamore into a fit of coughing as a wave of nausea and pain overtook him. “You’re a greedy pup, aren’t you? Taking money from grateful fools but unwilling to spread it around.”

Mastiff grabbed Sycamore by the hair, pulling his head roughly up to stare into his eyes. “But what should I expect from some swamp-eyed silkhair. Greed runs through your veins, doesn’t it, scarecrow brat?” He slapped Sycamore across the face with an openhanded blow, and Sycamore felt his lip split, tasting iron as blood filled his mouth.

A few more heavy blows to the torso and Mastiff seized his shirt, tugging him loose from the other man’s grip and throwing him to the ground. He landed hard on the rough planks of the floor, and he felt splinters break off in his skin as his arm dragged across the ground. He took a heaving gasp for breath, and from his ribs felt a shock of pain.

“Find his purse and take the rest,” Mastiff said, stepping heavily on Sycamore’s shoulder. He let out a short moan of pain from the ground – his shoulder had not yet healed from the rough treatment on night of the bandit attack.

Sycamore’s drunken escort to the cursed hut huddled over him, grabbing at his waist, looking for his purse with shaky hands. “Don’t mind me, young master, just and old drunk who needs some coin. Don’t mind me.” After a moment of searching, he found the purse. He sliced it away with a clumsy movement, and Sycamore felt the blade bite into his leg. “Nicked you there, young master, sorry about that.” The man rose, handing the heavy pouch to Mastiff who grinned down at Sycamore.

“There, that wasn’t so hard, was it pup? I get mine and you get yours,” He said. He turned to his accomplices. “Send the others off. Let’s be finished with this sty.”

Sycamore rolled over onto his back in a painful motion, staring up at the tattooed man with a half-lidded gaze. His body burned with pain. His lips were swollen, and his words were clumsy, but he forced out a desperate protest as the men made to leave.

“I just wanted to help,” He said in a painful wheeze, blood bubbling out of his mouth with his words. He sputtered a bloody cough.

Mastiff looked between Sycamore and the heavy coin purse now clutched in his three-fingered hand. He crouched down, bringing his hand up to Sycamore’s face. Sycamore flinched at the motion, and Mastiff chuckled.

“Believe me, pup, you did help,” He said, patting Sycamore on the face twice before rising and stepping out of the shack, leaving Sycamore where he lay in silent agony.
