_My companion asked the boy, one day, to sing us a song of his youth. After some pestering, he finally agreed. His voice was skittish at first, but gained in volume and confidence as he continued. He sang in foreign words, with the language of the Halflings. His voice carried the tune true in the clear autumn air. It was a somber song, with a deep sadness that sunk into my bones. At the song’s end, he gave us an awkward smile, thanked us for listening. My curiosity wanted me to ask of the songs meaning, but my sense held my tongue. To try to explain a feeling was to rob it of its importance._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian._ 

----

Sycamore’s evening was a rush of weary movement. They threw together some travel packs and made to flee the vineyard, everyone following behind Sycamore at his insistence he knew the perfect place to pass the time in peace. They piled the corpses in front of the farmhouse and left with the setting of the sun.

In their flight to the Magus’s sanctum, they skirted the paths, kicked through bushes and undergrowth to avoid notice. With the children, Mrs. Maple’s father, and Lupin’s poor health, they made slow time. When they finally reached the hill, it was deep into night and the drain of the day’s events had begun to take hold. Sycamore opened the stairwell with a prod to the Magus’s essence, and the others threw him a flurry of questions. He brushed them off, though, pleading to save explanations for when he was less drowsy. With few complaints, they followed him down the stairs into the torchlight below. The Magus, too, demanded an explanation, but Sycamore hardly heard him. He threw his travel pack on the ground to serve as a pillow and all but collapsed. He was asleep before his head touched the pack.

He awoke travel-weary, all too aware that he had slept in an awkward position. He was sore across his body, and the side of his head throbbed with a wide bruise. His aches and pains served as a momentary distraction from the previous day’s events, but as he fully awoke and adjusted, the memories returned. He was almost thankful to the night’s exhaustion. Without it he may have not been able to sleep for thoughts of corpses and smoke.

He sat up with a low groan, looked around to take stock of the room. Pike slept closest to him, his spear laid carefully aside, far enough that there was no risk of accidental injury. Mrs. Maple had arranged her family close to the stairwell. She was wrapped, with her two children, in a large cloak, and her father slept beside them with his own cloak as a blanket. Lupin was furthest from the others, curled in the fetal position, flush against one of the walls of bookshelves. They all still slept.

“I believe you owe me an explanation,” The Magus’s voice boomed.

Sycamore flinched at the volume, and was surprised when none of the others awoke.

“Hush,” He said in a whisper, “Do not wake the others. They need much rest after yesterday.”

“They cannot hear me. That is a function of your soul magic. Now explain, please.” His voice was terse, neutral. Rarely did Sycamore hear much emotion from the Magus, but here he felt a sense that he was irritated.

“I thought this place would be a good spot to – That is to say we were fleeing from – Perhaps I should say that after I found the village –” He paused, rubbing at a spot in his leg, numb from how he slept. “I suppose I’ll start from when I left you yesterday.”

----

“Once, long ago, there was an old woman,” Sycamore said. Hickory and Mist sat on his lap, one child for each leg, looking down at the book in his hands. It was a big, old thing, bound in wood with vellum pages, yellowed with age. Colorful images decorated the pages alongside words of the Westfolk tongue. It was unreadable to Sycamore, so the Magus supplied the story.

“Though she always wanted children of her own, she had none. One day, she saw a bright star in the sky and wished upon it that she could have her own child.” The children were entranced by the pictures on the page, captured by their vivid color. The book was from one of the Magus’s shelves, provided on their second day of isolation in the library. He explained that it was from when his apprentices were young.

“She dreamed that night of a flower petal falling from a tree slowly and happily to land in her bedroom. When she awoke, there was a baby on her windowsill. In honor of the star who had brought this light to her life, she named the baby Starlight.” 

The explanations over the sanctum in the hill and the nature of the Magus had consumed much of their first morning. When, finally, understanding and acceptance had been reached, they’d further argued over how long to spend in hiding. Unsurprisingly, Lupin was heavily in favor of leaving as soon as possible to pursue his revenge. Mrs. Maple advocated patience to protect the safety of her family. Pike and Sycamore lay somewhere in the middle, conflicted for all sorts of reasons. Sycamore saw in his friend the warring interests of concern for the children and concern for his brother. Sycamore felt the urgency of helping his family pull against the dread of confronting the corpses in the village again.

In the end, they decided to hide for three days in the sanctum.

“For a time, they were happy. The old woman raised Starlight as her son. He grew quickly, helping around their farm and filling the old woman’s days with laughter and love. But then, one day, the old woman fell ill.”

Time passed slowly, isolated as they were in a small stone library. The Magus proved to have more control of the hill than even Sycamore knew, providing a space to serve as a restroom and a bubbling fountain of drinkable water from the ground.

“Starlight took care of her as best he could, but she became more and more ill. He went from house to house, pleading to all they knew for some cure to her illness. Finally, an old man told him of a far off land ruled by a wizard who knew everything. And so, promising his mother he would return with a cure, Starlight set off to find the wizard.”

The second night of their isolation, Sycamore barely slept. When his eyes shut, he saw a grumpy old man, a one-eyed blank stare, frothy blood on a mouth uttering silent curses. He rolled back and forth on the stone floor, searching for comfort but finding none. Sounds of movement and fidgeting had filled the sanctum that night, and not only from Sycamore. In the dark, stone room, sound carried well: the shifting of a sleepless body, the whimpers of quiet tears.

“Starlight walked, following stories of the wizard until he reached a tall tower. Inside the tower was the wizard, a grumpy man who cared about nothing besides his magic. Starlight approached him, pleaded for help to cure his mother, but the wizard refused.”

On the second day of the isolation, their frustrations began to grow. Lupin, dissatisfied with everything, filled the room with his complaints. He recovered slowly from his injury and from the tax of his healing. He still looked to be halfway to death, bloodshot eyes the only color on his pallid face, but he insisted he was healthy and demanded they speed up their schedule. Sycamore and Pike mostly ignored him, but his frustration started to influence the children, who grew restless no matter how Mrs. Maple cooed and played with them. Seeing this, the Magus suggested the children’s books.

“The wizard, greedy for knowledge and uncaring of others, saw no benefit to helping Starlight, but the boy was persistent. He stayed for days at the foot of the wizard’s tower, calling up pleas and requests to help save his mother. Eventually, the wizard relented.”

Of everyone, the one seemed most at ease was Mrs. Maple’s father. He was mostly deaf and blind, and spent most of his time sitting in silence when he wasn’t helping with the children. Gramps, as they called him, was a doting grandfather, somehow procuring endless treats from his pack as he played with them.

“The wizard told Starlight that if he could find a blue rose, a cure would be made and his mother would be recovered. Delighted by this, Starlight set out in search, not knowing that the wizard had tricked him. In all his years of life, the wizard had never seen a blue rose, and knew such a thing did not exist.”

Sycamore used his time to practice in his soul magic. He continued to study his own essence, and he often recruited Pike to observe his friend’s soul. He even managed to convince him to slice a small cut into his hand to demonstrate his healing to the Magus. Of course, this brought about all sorts of muttering and technical questions from the Magus that Sycamore could not answer. 

“In pursuit of the blue rose, Starlight searched forests, meadows, and towns. All who he asked of the blue rose laughed at him, and eventually he realized he was tricked. Desperate as he was to convince the wizard to teach him the cure, he bought from a trader a beautiful blue glass rose.”

Perhaps most surprising from their isolation was the Magus’s unlikely fondness for children. Though he tried to mask it with aloofness, his constant fretting to Sycamore over their comfort and care painted a clear picture.

“Starlight returned to the wizard and presented him with the glass rose. The wizard laughed at the boy, calling him a fool and banishing him from his tower. Hearing this, Starlight-” Sycamore paused with a frown. After a moment, he hesitantly continued, “Starlight pleaded once more with the wizard, who, seeing the boys need, taught him the cure.” Sycamore turned the page, hoping the children had not noticed the inconsistency in his story.

“Finally, with the cure, Starlight returned home, cured his mother, and they lived happily for many years after. The end.” The children turned to Sycamore, Hickory pleading for another story and Mist mimicking her brother’s body language. Sycamore happily agreed, and made to grab another book off the shelf.

_You changed the story._ The Magus said. One thing Sycamore had learned since their isolation began was the ability to send words over a connection of the soul. It required little more than wrapping the thoughts within a connection between their two essences. Useful to have a private conversation with the Magus even in the present situation, and good training for his soul sight. Sycamore would teach the skill to his mother, after she was free from the Fireglass.

_I did not think it appropriate to describe Starlight beating the wizard to death with the glass rose._ Sycamore replied. It was a strange thing, to hear and say words only in your mind, almost perverse in how secretive it was. 

_Appropriate, perhaps not, but in there a lesson common among the Westfolk._ Sycamore carefully placed the book back into the shelf, grabbing another story, about a girl who rides rainbows. Unlike the story of Starlight, it did not conclude with murder.

_That violence is the solution to a problem?_

_That power, knowledge, progress ought to be earned, not given. Sometimes solving a problem requires a drastic solution._ Sycamore sat back down on the floor, beckoning the children to return to their seats. He enjoyed spending time with them. It lent a sense of normalcy to their situation, their naïve understanding of what was happening a fresh contrast to his own grim thoughts.  

_Peace, when it’s available, is always preferable to violence._ 

_Then did you find a peaceable end with the invaders of your village?_

_That was different. They killed members of my clan, burnt my house to the ground._

_Did the wizard not condemn Starlight’s mother to death by refusing to heal her? Different in nuance, perhaps, but at the core of the issue, much the same._ That gave Sycamore pause. It felt wrong in his stomach to compare his killing of the Fireglass raiders to Starlight’s murder of the wizard, but then, he hadn’t looked for a peaceful solution either. The raider had even approached him with conversation. Was it right for him to kill the man just because he stood over the charred remnants of his house? Perhaps there was hypocrisy in his distaste for the story.

The children sat waiting for Sycamore to start the new story. Hickory pulled impatiently at his sleeve as mist grabbed at the cover, waiting for Sycamore to open it. He was lost in his thoughts of a glass rose and a sling stone.

Finally, the Magus interrupted his pondering. _Hurry, Sycamore, the children grow impatient. Good, is it, for you to reflect over your actions. To be paralyzed by such reflection, though, leads to nothing but regret._

-----

On the final morning of their hiding, the Magus repeated his offer to Sycamore.

_You study quickly and well. I believe you now know enough to understand our bargain more fully. If you agree, I can help you attain knowledge, power. Perhaps enough to help you with your current problems._ The Magus spoke to him as they packed their bags. There was a somber air about the sanctum, eagerness contained within caution. They wanted to be out of the small stone room, but they did not know what to expect of the village. They had hidden in hopes that the Fireglass would leave, but they had no guarantees of such happening.

_Perhaps that is true, but I still have not decided if it is the right decision._ Sycamore had learned much about souls since beginning his studies, but what he knew paled in comparison to the Magus. He learned quickly, yes, but a month of study would never match up to decades of rigorous academia. With such imbalance in their knowledge, to bind his soul was a large commitment.

_A lack of trust, then?_ The Magus said. Emotions seemed more difficult when they spoke via their souls, and Sycamore heard the open disappointment in his voice.

_Any distrust I had of you came to an end when you showed yourself a willing, gracious host. I will not forget that when I was in need you came to my aid. It’s just –_ “Pike,” Sycamore said aloud, “What is your Pa’s advice about making decisions hastily?”

Pike, in the middle of his own packing, looked up at Sycamore with a confused look. “Never make a big decision when you’re hungry, tired, angry,” He said, “Are you speaking with the Magus?” They could not hear the voice of the Magus, but knew that Sycamore was communicating with him somehow throughout their time in the library.

Sycamore nodded at his friend before resuming his communication with the Magus, _As Pike’s Pa says, don’t make a decision while – well, he doesn’t include great duress and life-threatening danger on his list, but I think he would approve of my caution._

Sycamore heard the Magus sigh, an odd thing to come through the soul, _Very well, then. I would ask that you avoid dying. It would be dreadfully dull to wait for another talented youth to find my Sanctum._

Sycamore couldn’t help but smile. _I promise you, Magus, I’ll return and give your offer some proper consideration once this business with the Fireglass is resolved. For taking us in like this, I owe you at least that much._ They finished their packing, and the hill grumbled as the stairwell to the surface opened.

_Take care of the children,_ The Magus said as they stepped up the stairs, _Their laughter served as a welcome distraction from the angry one’s whinging._ Sycamore stifled a laugh, waving a farewell to the Magus’s alter. Then, he stepped into the sunlight for the first time in three days.

Sycamore muttered a cruse when his spade struck a rock. He stood knee deep in a large pit, dug to serve as a grave for their fallen clansmen. Lupin and Gramps were somewhere distant from the death and destruction, watching Hickory and Mist. Next to him, Pike and Mrs. Maple held spades of their own, slowly widening and deepening the half-dug hole. They needed a large grave to hold seventeen bodies.

Seventeen. Seventeen members of the Heartwood clan. Seventeen faces frozen in their final expressions. Seventeen bodies, picked at by carrion eaters. If Sycamore looked at it with cold analysis, it was a shock that so few had died considering the ruined state of their village. But when he looked at it as a child of the Heartwood clan, it was a shock to think that seventeen of his friends and neighbors lay dead.

Mrs. Maple spoke to them of the Fireglass clan while they worked.

“Twenty years ago, when we fled from the east, it was a long, difficult journey. Few clans would treat us peaceably, either because of old grudges with the Heartwood or because they did not wish to upset those we left by helping us. I was seventeen at the time, and I didn’t fully understand why we had fled. Gramps, you see, was closed-mouthed about his experiences with battle, so I did not learn of such things until much later in my life.” She paused, leaning over to haul a rock too big for her space and toss it to the side of the grave.

“The first place we tried to settle,” She continued, “Was north of the Songwood. We were weary from our travels, ready to put down some roots and live peacefully away from death and war. Your mother, Sycamore, led us with an ideological fervor that allowed us to travel so far without losing hope. But even such things have their limits, and we reached those limits straight to the north of here.”

“When the first reports of bandits and thieves came in, we did not want to believe it. Everyone hoped they were lone incidents. We had just fled from violence, to have it follow us here would call under question our journey to that point. When they abducted our children for ransom, we could no longer deny it.” Sycamore stabbed his Spade into the ground, leaning on it for a bit of rest while he rubbed dust out of his eyes. 

“One day, a group of five children were out playing in the fields. The Fireglass rode up on one of their horse carts and grabbed them. One of their mother’s was close enough to hear their screams, but when she went looking for them, they were gone.”

“Did the Fireglass kill them?” Pike asked. There was a dark note to his tone. If the Fireglass killed those they took, it did not bode well for the others in their clan.

“No,” She said, shaking her head, “Two days later one of the Fireglass came to our village with a note of ransom. All our valuables, alcohol, and money in exchange for the five children.” Bitterness clouded her voice. “It was laughable. We’d left all those things behind when we fled west. We had nothing to give them, so their messenger said we’d never see our children again.”

Sycamore clenched his jaw. He imagined if Hickory and Mist had been taken. He knew Lotus and Lily, Lupin’s younger siblings, were captured with the rest of their clan. 

“Of course, we could not tolerate that, so we rallied for a desperate rescue attempt. Your mother, Sycamore, led many of the adults in our clan forward. Pike, your father and mother, yet unmarried at the time, joined the battle, as did Lupin’s father.”

“I thought my mother refused to do any act of violence after coming west?” Sycamore said. He did not doubt she would act to protect the children, but considering she had just surrendered their clan, he would have thought she might pursue a peaceful solution.

“She called it her final act of violence, and she did not fight happily. But those children were kin to her, people who had followed behind her in pursuit of her dream. I think she thought herself obligated to protect them,” Mrs. Maple sadly smiled, “There was a reluctance among the council to let her go to battle, because we all knew how such things affected her. But when the Storm Priestess offers to lead you on the battlefield, only a fool would refuse.” 

“The Storm Priestess?” Sycamore asked.

“An old name for your mother. One she cast off with our flight west,” Mrs. Maple said. She looked at Pike and Sycamore between movements of her spade. Both had stopped their digging to listen to the story. “You two aren’t going to let me do all the work, are you? My story can wait if you can’t dig and listen at the same time.” Hastily they resumed their spades’ movement, and her story continued.

“They set off to free the children, hunting down the Fireglass and demanding information about where our captive children were. I was too young to participate, so I am not aware of the specifics, but I heard your mother was a hurricane out there, oppressing all who stood in their way.” Sycamore swallowed. That was the second time, now, after Lupin’s description, that his mother had been described as a force of nature rather than a person. He wondered how powerful she truly was.

“Eventually they found the captured and fought for their freedom. When they returned, all five children lived, but many died along the way. Your brother, Sycamore, was among the rescued children, and his parents were two among the dead.” Sycamore’s eyes widened. His brother had never spoken of this, nor had his mother.

“After the battle, we fled the Fireglass south, through the Songwood, to where we are now. Since then we have interacted with them little, but always there was a fear that they would return to strike another blow to our peace.” She looked over her shoulder, where the village once stood whole, now lay broken. 

-----

It was late afternoon when they finished covering the bodies with dirt. It had been gruesome work, hauling the corpses to the grave. Already in the first stages of decomposition, they stank of death and decay, stomachs bloated, mouths and eyes foaming.

Mrs. Maple asked sycamore to deliver a eulogy to the fallen, conduct the funeral as his mother would. He knew little of such things, but she insisted that enough of his mother had rubbed off on him for him to do a better job than the rest.

“We’re here, of course to honor and remember our fallen clansmen,” Sycamore hesitantly began. Around him stood the others. Lupin looked bitter, Pike looked weary. Gramps was as mellow as ever, and Mist was distracted in his arms, fiddling with his hair. Mrs. Maple wore her ever-present calm, determined expression. Hickory, holding her hand, had a hint of understanding on his face, as if the significance of the funeral started to come to him.

“Three days ago, death and destruction came down on our village, tearing all that we know away from us. In the midst of this, seventeen members of the Heartwood clan were lost, taken from us before their times had come,” He paused, considering his words. “It is easy to speak of the attack and what it took from us, but we must remember that their lives were much more than just that tragedy. We cannot promise you all revenge, nor do I think you would demand it. What we can promise you, however, is to remember. We will remember you, for your laughter and joy. We will remember you for the peace we strove for, for the work we put into our village. We will remember you, too, for the points of disagreement, the words said in anger, because to honor you as members of our clan is to remember who you were in whole. We can remember, and we can say farewell. We wish you peace, and we give you thanks, for spending your lives as members of our Clan.” 

Sycamore swallowed. It was an awkward speech, depressing and hardly inspiring. Normally, after the eulogy, his mother would end with a prayer, but he knew he would stumble over the words, ruin the significance, so instead Sycamore began to sing. He did not wish to sing a song of mourning or death; such things already surrounded them. Instead, he sang a calm lullaby, somber in its tone, but peaceful, restful. It was a tune familiar to the Heartwood, and soon he heard the others join in his singing. Shortly after, the song ended, and the funeral concluded.

After the funeral, they began their journey east.
