_We walked through many of the skeletons of the Kingdoms’ eastward efforts. Old villages and outposts, dead from neglect or assault. Each of them told a story, and my eye was trained to discern it. The remnants spoke to me of fire or abandonment, and I connected these tales into a narrative of the downfall of human vanity. It was a bleak picture, but never bleaker than when the boy spotted some old bones tied to an oak post in the center of the village. He read the words under the display in a neutral voice: “Here hangs a heretic, his name discarded with his crimes. To taint the soul is to taint us all, and for his crimes he paid the price.” The boy paused to stare at the picture of Kingdom justice for a long while before we continued._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

A smile naturally found itself to Sycamore’s face as he returned to their shack. After healing Cottonmouth he’d followed a chain of requests across the shantytown. His leather pouch hung heavily at his waist, full of copper coins. It still made him mildly uncomfortable to take money for his work, but he only asked for as much as his patients were willing to pay. In his mind this relieved some of the discomfort he felt at the transactions, though his mother would probably still give him a swift smack on the head if she heard about it.

When he stepped into their shanty, Lupin and Pike were seated across from each other, playing a game of dexterity. One was the leader and the other had to react to their movements or be slapped on the hand. It was a common enough game from their childhood, and Sycamore was dreadful at it. They paused when he entered, looking up at him.

“It’s late,” Pike said, “I was starting to worry.”

Sycamore pulled the coin-laden pouch from his waist, tossing it to Pike. “I think I may have found a way for us to enter the city.”

Pike opened the pouch, spilling coins into his hand. His eyes widened.

“How’d you manage this?” Lupin asked, snagging a coin from Pike and examining it more closely. The coins were uneven little disks of copper, stamped on one side with the Whitebrook clan’s symbol, a waterfall. The other side was stamped with a boar, a common symbol of strength among the Hillfolk.

“Some folk needed healing, and insisted on paying me when I obliged,” Sycamore said with a grin.

“All this from one injury?” Pike asked as he refilled the pouch and tossed it back to Sycamore.

He snatched the bag out of the air and fastened it back on his waist. “Not just one. Many are injured, from the road or from raids. If you look around you’ll see most people walk with a limp or have some bandaged up wound.”

Pike nodded slowly. “Of course. We’re healthy because you’re here, but most people don’t have a healer around, do they?”

“As far as I can tell, healers are as rare as Westfolk around here,” Sycamore said.

“You always were an uncommon sort, Sprout.”

“I’m just mad we didn’t think of this sooner,” Lupin said, flicking the coin in his hand and catching it, “So what, you earn us enough money to get into the city?”

“Then all that remains is to convince their council to give us the aid we need,” Pike said with a sigh.

“It’s a step forward,” Sycamore said, “A step towards an army.”

“A step towards revenge,” Lupin said with a wicked grin.

------

Over the next three days, Sycamore slipped into a routine of healing, eating, and sleeping. It was a blur of injuries, from minor cuts and scrapes to wounds that would claim the patient’s life in a day if left untreated. Sycamore had never done so much healing, and he had not realized just how much the process drained him. He ended each day with a splitting headache, energy wrung out of him like an old wet rag. Thankfully, he awoke the next day hale enough to heal more people. 

Few injuries were as bad as Cottonmouth’s necrotic leg, but each wound carried with it a story, and after days of healing, Sycamore had a clearer picture of the devastation the Fireglass had caused throughout the western realm of the Hillfolk in the past months. A pattern emerged of the clan from the north taking prisoners in rapid raids for some unknown end. The Heartwood were hit with a larger force than most, perhaps because of the clans’ shared history, but few villages seemed to be unaffected by the Fireglass aggressions.

At first, many were skeptical to receive healing from “a Westfolk brat,” but after the first day, his reputation had spread enough that most treated him without bias. People still muttered curses and spat jeers, but when bones mended and cuts sealed, those words faded to gratefulness.

By the third afternoon of healing, Sycamore had earned almost enough money for them to pay admission to the city. It was twenty copper cents to a silver mark. As there were seven people in Sycamore’s group, admission to the city was a hefty sum of coins. Still, they were quickly approaching that sum, and Sycamore felt increasingly anxious to be out of the smelly, muddy shantytown and into the city proper.

“A thousand thanks,” the man said, rubbing at his jaw. Next to him, his wife grinned a shaky smile as she pressed a handful of coins into Sycamore’s hands.

“You’re very welcome,” Sycamore said, wincing at the building throb of pain in his head. This was perhaps the twenty-fifth person he had healed that day, a man with a jaw broken in some alcohol-fueled brawl. “I recommend avoiding any kind of violence for the coming weeks. The bone is weak when recently healed.”

“Of course, of course,” the man said with a lopsided grin, “The wine got the better of me before, but I’d rather not go through that pain again.”

“I’ll keep him sober and safe,” his wife said with a fierce look towards her husband. The genuine happiness on their faces brought a feeling of warmth to Sycamore that was almost addicting. Even without the money, Sycamore would have found it difficult to turn down folk in need, especially with how thankful his patients were.

With a smile and a nod, Sycamore excused himself, drawing his hood up and pushing out the shack through their ceaseless grateful words. He hoped the man would stay true to his word and avoid drunken fights, but what he had seen of the Shantytown planted a seed of doubt in his gut.

The rickety huts and muddy ground were ruled by the darkest emotions. Haunted memories and uncertain futures dominated people’s minds, and where despair ended, anger began. Violence was rampant among the refugees, and Sycamore often found himself toeing around folk brawling in the mud. There was little security, and the lawkeepers of Whitebrook had almost no presence outside the limits of the city. It was such that every third injury Sycamore healed was not a result of a Fireglass raid or an accident while travelling, but some broken bone from the hands of other refugees.

As he tramped through the mud back to their huts, Sycamore did some mental accounting. With the money he earned today and what Mrs. Maple had left over of her own money, they should have more than enough to pay for their entrance into the city. He felt a surge of relief and anticipation. One step closer to getting help for their clan.

“Hey, you. Boy, with the hood,” A nasally voice called out, interrupting Sycamore’s planning. Sycamore took a glance around. He was nearly alone on the path he walked, and he was the only one who had his hood drawn considering the clear evening weather. Certainly the voice addressed him.

He turned to the voice, studying the man who had called out to him. He sat astride a log with a rusted flask in his hand. His hair was in a tangle, and his face and clothes were caked in grime and mud. His nose hooked to the right from an old break, and with the filth it was impossible to place how old he was.

“Yes?” Sycamore asked hesitantly. Considering the flask in the man’s hand and the slur of his words, Sycamore feared he was some drunk looking for a scapegoat to take his anger out on.

“You wouldn’t happen to be that healer boy, would you?” The man said, a yellow-toothed smile coming to his face. “A fellow of mine could use your help, you know, and he’d pay coin for your time.”

Sycamore breathed a sigh of relief. Just someone else who needed healing. He was about to tell the man to lead the way when it occurred to him that he didn’t actually need the money – they had enough to pay the fee into the city already, and he was starting to worry after his own health from the repeated healings. He carefully examined his soul every day to look for signs of strain or weakness, but he was not enough of an expert to see every detail.

Still, even after getting into the city, they would need money for lodging and food, so any coin he could gather would be welcome. Besides, if the man’s friend needed help, it was all Sycamore could do to provide it.

“If your fellow needs help, I’d be happy to do what I can,” Sycamore said.

“Right then,” The man said, taking a swig from his flask as he rose to his feet. He took a stumbling first two steps before his drunken balance took over, and he gestured for Sycamore to follow after him.

The man spoke as he led Sycamore along. “We’ve heard much about you,” He said, “I didn’t believe it at first, a Westfolk boy wandering the shanties fixing people up for not more than a bit of coin.” He threw a glance over his shoulder at Sycamore, his eyes glinting in the light of a nearby torch, “I bet you’ve made it pretty, what with the number of fools walking around half-dead.”

Sycamore chuckled awkwardly before replying, “That I can bring people back to health is as important as the coin, I think.”

“Oh, don’t mind me, young master,” The man said, “I don’t mean to question your character. By the wind and the sea, I know the value of a few coins, especially in times like these. Don’t mind me. Just an old drunk running his mouth.”

Sycamore hummed noncommittally, slightly off-put by the man’s slurred ramblings. Still, it was folly to read too far into a drunk man’s words, and he had few options beyond following the man or leaving without healing his friend. After all he pain he’d seen over the past days, Sycamore’s conscious would haunt him if he didn’t at least try to help.

They wove through the muddy paths for several long minutes before they paused in front of a particularly large hut. In front was a group of rough-looking men huddled around a table, dicing over cups of some alcohol. They looked up at Sycamore with cold eyes as he approached.

“Don’t mind them,” Sycamore’s escort assured, “Just some fellows caught in drink. Come in here, then, my man is right inside.” Sycamore nodded, hurrying past the men as they stared at him, and pushing inside the door of the shack.

Sycamore’s nose stung at the thick stench of the air, the alcoholic bite of spirits mixed with the sour smell of body odor and the smoky scent of cooked meat. A pair of men sat on either side of a cookfire, roasting a pair of rodents on a spit. 

One of the men looked much like Sycamore’s drunken escort, but the other was much more distinctive. One side of his head was shaven, and dark tattooed lines looped around his ear. It was not the first time Sycamore had seen tattoos, as some of the older members of Sycamore’s clan had tattoos. They were common among career military folk, and from the size of this man, he looked the part. 

“Is this the healer brat, then?” The tattooed man said, looking over Sycamore with a piercing gaze. The edges of his mouth hooked up in a mockery of a grin that made Sycamore want to grab at his coin purse.

“Brought ‘em like you said, Mastiff,” Sycamore’s escort said.

“And you’ll get your due, should he prove as helpful as I hope.”

“I’m the healer, yes,” Sycamore said, pulling his hood down, “Your man here told me that someone needs healing. Would that be you?”

“So he’s really a Westfolk boy,” Mastiff said, “I wouldn’t have guessed.”

“I told you my information was good,” said the other man at the fire.

Impatience tugged at Sycamore, unease at the way they spoke, “I came here because I heard someone needs healing. Is it true or not?” The stench of the room fed Sycamore’s headache, the stuffy, smoky air adding to the throbbing pain.

“Yes, I was just getting to that,” Mastiff said as he and the other rose to their feet. He strode leisurely towards Sycamore. The smoothness of his step, the calmness in his voice tugged at Sycamore’s instincts. He didn’t seem to be injured in any way. “They say that you can heal anything, pup, even bringing people from the brink of death.”

“An exaggeration,” Sycamore said, “but the details are difficult, so it’ll be easier if you just show me what needs healing.”

“Right, right,” Mastiff said with a lazy smile, “What about this, then?” He held up a hand, revealing that two of his fingers had been severed just before the first knuckle. They were old wounds, long since scarred over.

Sycamore looked at the wounds for an instant before shaking his head with a frown. “I’m sorry,” He said, “I can’t heal anything missing from the body. A broken or crushed finger I could mend, but as soon as it’s been severed from the body, there’s nothing I can do.” Not that he had ever tried, but the conventional wisdom taught by his mother said as much.

“Now step back a moment,” Mastiff said, his brow furrowing but still wearing that half-smile, “I heard you were the savior of the shanties, capable of healing any wound short of death.” He turned to the other man, “Isn’t that what you heard?”

“I head the same, and my information’s good.”

Mastiff flicked a thumb at his friend. “He says his information’s good. So tell me again, why can’t you heal something as little as a pair of lopped off fingers? Do you think you’re too good to heal someone like me?”

Sycamore swallowed, feeling a sudden need to be out of the stuffy shack as soon as possible. He took a hesitant step backwards, frowning when his shoulder bumped into his escort to the shack. “I’m sorry, but whoever told you that much was mistaken about the extent of my ability. I can’t heal your fingers. Now, please excuse me.” He made to spin around and rush out of the shack, but was caught in his tracks when Mastiff’s three-fingered hand fell heavily on his shoulder, gripping tightly and holding him in place.

“Wait just a moment. You can’t dash my hopes and then just prance out of here like nothing’s wrong. I’ve been excitedly waiting to meet you, looking forward to having my fingers back. You’ve taken that joy from me, I think you owe me something in return.” With his free hand, Mastiff tapped at his chin for a moment, feigning thought. “Ah! I’ve got it. Give me your coin.”

Sycamore scowled at his captor, cursing his own naïveté. He had seen the crime and violence of the shantytown, why had he not recognized the threat it posed to him? Why had he ignored his instincts about his escort, about the men perched outside the shack? A hundred curses for his own stupidity boiled in his mind, and a hundred more for the men who threatened him. His head ached and was swimming so much that he could not feel the pulse of the wind’s power. He had a knife at his waist, but hardly wanted to brandish the blade over some coin. He was left at the mercy of these men, defenseless and alone. Still, now that he had dug the pit, there was little to do besides grit his teeth and try to climb out.

“Ten cents,” Sycamore said, reaching into his coin purse and pulling the copper coins from it.

“What’s that?” Mastiff said, his smile widening slightly.

“I’ll give you ten cents to let me be,” Sycamore said with a huff. He would pay the men, but he wouldn’t pretend to be happy about it. He held out a hand, offering the ten copper disks to the man.

Mastiff’s eyes glanced down to Sycamore’s outstretched hand. With a nod, he took the coins from Sycamore, sliding them into his own purse.

“There’s a smart lad,” Mastiff said, releasing Sycamore’s shoulder. Sycamore let out a tense sigh. It hurt to give these scoundrels some of his hard-earned money, but ten coins was a manageable price to pay

Sycamore’s eyes flicked around the room. “I’ll be going then,” He said with a stiff nod.

The punch caught him across the jaw before he had a chance to react. Lights exploded across his vision and pain exploded across his face. He stumbled backwards only to be caught by his escort, who looped his arms around Sycamore’s, holding him firmly in place.

“Do you think me daft?” Mastiff said as Sycamore struggled to regain his composure. The half-smile on his face had resolved into an angry sneer. Sycamore shook his head, vainly trying to banish the daze from the punch.

“We’ve seen you prancing about this pit of muck and scum, taking coin from saps with cuts and bruises, and you offer me ten cents?” The second punch slammed into his stomach, sending Sycamore into a fit of coughing as a wave of nausea and pain overtook him. “You’re a greedy pup, aren’t you? Taking money from grateful fools but unwilling to spread it around.”

Mastiff grabbed Sycamore by the hair, pulling his head roughly up to stare into his eyes. “But what should I expect from some swamp-eyed silkhair. Greed runs through your veins, doesn’t it, Westfolk brat.” He slapped Sycamore across the face with an openhanded blow, and Sycamore felt his lip split, tasting iron as blood filled his mouth.

A few more heavy blows to the torso and Mastiff seized his shirt, tugging him loose from the other man’s grip and throwing him to the ground. He landed hard on the rough planks of the floor, and he felt splinters break off in his skin as his arm dragged across the ground.

“Find his purse and take the rest,” Mastiff said, stepping heavily on Sycamore’s shoulder. He let out a short moan of pain from the ground – his shoulder had not yet healed from the rough treatment on night of the bandit attack.

The man who had escorted Sycamore huddled over him, grabbing at his waist, looking for his purse. “Don’t mind me, young master, just and old drunk who needs some coin. Don’t mind me.” After a moment of searching, he found the purse. He sliced it away with a clumsy movement, and sycamore felt the blade bite into his leg. “Nicked you there, young master, sorry about that.” The man rose, handing the heavy pouch to Mastiff who grinned down at Sycamore.

“There, that wasn’t so hard, was it pup? I get mine and you get yours,” He said. He turned to his accomplices. “Send the others off. Let’s make a move.

Sycamore rolled over onto his back in a painful motion, staring up at the tattooed man with a half-lidded gaze. His body burned with pain. His lips were swollen, and his words were clumsy, but he forced out a desperate protest to the way he’d been treated.

“I just wanted to help,” He said in a painful wheeze, blood bubbling out of his mouth with his words.

Mastiff looked between Sycamore and the heavy coin purse now clutched in his three-fingered hand. He crouched down, bringing his hand up to Sycamore’s face. Sycamore flinched at the motion, and Mastiff chuckled.

“Believe me, pup, you did help,” He said, patting Sycamore on the face twice before rising and stepping out of the shack, followed by his cronies.

-----

Pike found him limping back to their hut, blood still seeping from his cuts and scrapes.

“Stormy skies, is that you, Sprout?” Pike said, rushing to Sycamore, supporting him with a shoulder. Sycamore gratefully leaned against his friend, removing some of the weight from his aching limbs.

“What happened?” Pike asked.

“Man named Mastiff took my purse, laid me out,” Sycamore said, spitting a glop of bloody phlegm to the side.

“Dammit,” Pike said, “I knew I should have gone with you, watched your back. Things are too rough out here.”

“Wouldn’t have helped. There were too many of them to fight back. They led me like a rabbit to the snare,” Sycamore clenched his jaw, wincing at the surge of pain from where Mastiff punched him. “My own foolish lack of caution caused this.”

“Enough of that,” Pike said, “We’ll get you patched up back with the others.”

“They took the money, Pike,” Sycamore said, “All that I earned today was in my purse. We can’t afford to go into the city without it.”

“That’s alright, Sprout,” Pike assured him, “most of it is back in the hut. We’ll be okay.” That was true at least. It would set them back, surely, but they still had enough that with a little more effort they could afford the fee to get into the city.

It was a painful walk back to their shelters, and Sycamore was glad to see the familiar shapes of the huts. Those feelings did not last when they stepped inside to find Lupin in the middle of a ransacked mess. Sycamore’s stomach plunged.

Their packs were torn apart, clothes and possessions scattered about the room. Sycamore saw his spare shirt, stomped into the ground and covered in mud. He saw his last bit of jerky, saved for a celebration, slotted between two of the floor planks. Most of his possessions he spotted throughout the hut. The one thing he did not see was the linen bag where they stored their money. In the middle of it all lay Lupin, curled on his side, his eye swollen shut and his ankle twisted at an awkward angle. He was shaking with barely controlled sobs.

With a curse, Pike released Sycamore and the pair rushed over to Lupin on the ground. Sycamore moved to roll the boy onto his back, frowning when he flinched at Sycamore’s touch. He looked even worse than Sycamore felt. His face was a mess of bruising, one eye swollen shut and the other blackened. Blood seeped at his hairline where his scalp had been torn with rough treatment. Sycamore imagined his torso was a mess of abrasions and bruises, and his ankle was clearly broken. 

When Lupin recognized them, he began to mutter apologies.

“I’m sorry, Sycamore. I tried to fight them off but they took the money,” He said. Tears streamed out of his eyes, leaving streaks in his grime-covered face.

“That’s alright, Lupin. It’s not your fault,” Sycamore said. He turned to Pike, “We need to set the bone before I can heal him. I want you to brace his leg.”

Pike nodded but gave Sycamore a concerned look, “Can you even properly heal in your current state? Don’t forget that you were also on the receiving end of a beating.”

“I can’t very well leave him like this,” Sycamore said with a frown. His headache was still there, but it was impossible to say how much of it was from the assault by Mastiff and how much was from over-healing. 

Pike looked at him for a long moment before finally nodding. “Just tell me what I need to do.”

“Just hold his leg and make sure he doesn’t squirm too much,” Sycamore said before looking to Lupin. “We’re going to set your leg now Lupin. This is going to hurt, but as soon as it’s finished I can heal you.”

The boy was hardly listening. “You worked so hard to get us that money, and I just let them take it. I’m sorry for my weakness.”

Sycamore sighed, hoping Lupin would recover somewhat when the healing was through. He reached out to the boy with his Healer’s Touch, wincing as a spike of pain buried itself in his head. He bit back a curse as the pain slowly faded, and Sycamore assessed the boy’s Soul. Thankfully, he wasn’t losing much blood and his wounds were mostly superficial, so despite how he looked, he still had energy to spare for healing.

Sycamore moved to Lupin’s leg. “Hold him steady, Pike,” He warned. Pike grunted understanding, leaning to hold down Lupin’s legs. Sycamore took a deep breath and jerked Lupin’s ankle, sliding the bone back into the correct position. Even before Lupin yelped in pain, Sycamore was already starting the healing, guiding the boy’s essence to his various wounds and watching with a keen eye as his injuries repaired themselves.

While the healing happened, Sycamore felt an off-putting sensation of himself being drained. When the process finished, he felt a discomforting emptiness. Fearing the state of his soul, he directed his Healer’s Touch inward. He winced when he saw the erratic, abnormal movement of the ball of energy that lay at his core, realizing that Pike had been right to worry about whether he could heal Lupin.

Though his physical state had improved, Lupin’s emotional state was much the same after the healing.

“I’m sorry, Sycamore,” He said again, “I couldn’t do anything. They came and demanded our money, and I couldn’t stop them.”

“Right, right,” Sycamore said, feeling a sudden surge of wooziness as his weakeness from his own beating caught up to him. He had pushed it off to tend to Lupin, but he was exhausted and in pain.

“We’d finally found an avenue forward, a way to make progress, but I let the hope slip through my fingers with my own impotence.” 

“That’s okay, don’t worry,” Sycamore muttered, rubbing at his head to try to banish the daze.

“It’s not okay!” Lupin said, “I complain and moan only to fail to do anything to help us in our goals. It would have been better for you to have left me dead on the floor of the smithy, then at least I would not be holding you back!”

Before he could offer his assurances for a third time, Sycamore felt the last bit of his consciousness fade, and he fell forward, fainting in a heap.

-----

As he lay on the hill staring up at the sky, Sycamore realized he was altogether tired of aching. A punch to the head from a Fireglass raider at Mrs. Maple’s vineyard, his shoulder roughly torn up in the fight with the bandits, and now a collection of bruises, cuts, and scrapes. His memory since the assault on the village seemed to be little beyond various shades of pain and despair.

Administrator Moss was apologetic that they had been assaulted, but offered little help besides a promise that he would arrest a man matching Mastiff’s description if he tried to gain entrance to the city. He had winced at Sycamore’s description. Severed fingers were an old punishment for thievery, still used in places where fines were deemed insufficient. It should have been the first tip that the man was a scoundrel.

Sycamore’s soul had weakened considerably from healing too much; so much so that it would probably be a week before he would be comfortable healing anyone again. Because of this, they could not continue as they were before, healing for money. Their plan to move forward had been squashed, just like that.

So, with nothing to do but wallow in his pain, Sycamore spent the afternoon lounging on a hill, far enough from the shantytown that he could not smell the stench of mud and despair that hung over that place. He stared into the sky, watching the clouds float by and feeling the wind brush over him.

As he lay there, in the shade of an oak tree, he wondered about the wind. When it set off, from wherever the wind came from, did it know where it was going? Did it choose a destination, follow a path until it arrived? Or did it wander without a whim, going wherever it chose, past mountain and storm, until it came to rest where it needed to be. It was a futile thing, to ponder the wind, but things as they were, Sycamore found himself longing to dissolve into the breeze, be taken on a journey whichever way his heart desired. At least then, perhaps, he would no longer ache with endless injuries.

“Sycamore?” A girl’s voice called out, “Is that Sycamore, of the Heartwood clan?”

Sycamore, pulled from his daydreams, sat up in a hasty motion, wincing with the movement. He looked around, searching for the source of the voice. It was a familiar voice, tugged at his memory.

“Sycamore, up here!” The voice said, and Sycamore looked up. Above him, in the branches of the oak tree, a girl sat, legs dangling over a limb, her hair hanging over her face so he couldn’t identify her.

“Who’s that?” Sycamore called up to her.

“Hold, a moment, I’ll climb down,” The girl said. A scramble of movement later, and she landed on the ground softly. She wore common clothes, and the only thing individual about her was the bow on her shoulder and the quiver on her hip. Sycamore’s eyes widened inn recognition.

“Juniper?” He said, jaw dropping. He hadn’t seen her since her father’s funeral. “Of course!” He said, nearly smacking himself in the forehead, “You came east to Whitebrook.”

“Yes, yes,” She said, “But what happened to you? You look like you’ve been through a storm. And what are you doing in Whitebrook? Are Aunt Poppy and Jackdaw with you? I still owe them thanks for that business before.” 

Sycamore’s breath caught in his throat when he realized she knew nothing of the raid on the village. She knew nothing of the truth of her father’s death.

He shakily rose to his feet, discarding the aches and pains, “Come with me to the others. I believe we have much to explain.”

-----

“So my father, his death was not an accident?” Juniper asked after Sycamore finished the explanation. He’d led the girl to their shacks, and the others had been overjoyed to see Juniper. None were particularly close with the girl, but any friendly face was worth celebrating.

“No,” Sycamore confirmed, “I’m sorry it was kept from you. My mother did not wish to burden you with such dark information.” He glanced around at the muddy, filthy shack, “Though, now such thoughts seem to be naïve denials for reality.”

She nodded, “Things started to get worse shortly after I arrived at the city. I think I always knew, somehow, that it was connected to my father’s death.” She smiled sadly. “I guess this just confirms what I already believed.”

“I’m sorry,” Sycamore repeated.

There was a heavy moment of silence before Mrs. Maple spoke up. “It is wonderful to see another familiar face, dear. Have you been living in the city?”

“With my aunt, yes,” Juniper replied politely. Though she was a member of their clan, none were particularly close to her, as she had always been quiet, spending most of her time in the Songwood with her father.

“How did you end up on that hill?” Sycamore asked. If he was in the city, you’d have to drag him kicking and screaming if you wanted him to leave.

She smiled at him, “I was looking for you, actually. Yesterday as I wandered the city, I heard a rumor that there was a Westfolk boy healing folk among the refugees. I figured it was too specific not to be you, so I hoped to spot you and Aunt Poppy.” Her smile fell from her face, “I wanted to thank your family for helping me when my father died.”

“If my mother were here, she’d scold you for trying to thank her for doing her job,” Sycamore said with a small smile. He was surprised that the rumors of his healing had extended even into the city, but he was glad that something positive had come out of his efforts, even after being robbed. He poked at a sore spot on his side. If his mother would here, that also would not be a problem.

“Well, that may be true, but I believe I can be of some help to your current problems,” Juniper said.

“You have money?” Lupin asked.

“That’s far too much to ask of her,” Mrs. Maple said.

“Well, My aunt probably has enough money, but I was thinking of a different way,” Juniper explained, “You see, my Aunt’s wife is on the Whitebrook council.”

Sycamore frowned, not understanding.

Pike was the first to realize it, “She can sponsor us!”

Sycamore’s eyes widened. He had been so focused on the money that he had forgotten the other way to bypass the checkpoint.

Juniper nodded confirmation, “I’m not sure of the rules, but she has enough standing on the council to get seven people into the city. Besides, I’m sure my aunt would be more than happy to put you up and give you rooms in her manor. I’ll have to run to get her to sign something, but hopefully by this evening, you can be out of this muddy shack and into the city.”
