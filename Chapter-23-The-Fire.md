_One day we came to an empty field, with nothing but a stone spire. It was a marker of glory and death. The final battle of the Brush Wars, when the Halfling lord and Kingdom general had killed each other, and the armies had retreated. Without their leaders, the war seemed pointless to the men and women who fought. My companion mentioned that she had heard of the battle, could see it in her mind, armies, tens of thousands of men and women, fighting each other to the death. The boy said little, but remarked darkly that in his mind, he could not see it, but could smell it._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

They were still a good distance from Mistfield, and it would take some time before they would be in skirmishing range. They kept a brisk pace, not quite a jog but faster than their standard march. It was a loose enough formation to add difficulty to the archers’ aim, but tight enough that they moved as a singular mass. Sycamore moved silently, mind frantically trying to catch up with the circumstances of the battle. Soon, arrows would start flying, and it would be his job to stop them from getting killed.

His mind blanked at the thought, and only the Magus’s pestering woke him up. _You must give your squad orders. You are in command, Sycamore,_ He sent in a tense voice. Sycamore turned to the other two speakers. They walked beside him with grim expressions on their faces. Sycamore was about to speak when a burst of uncertainty assaulted him.

_How should we go about deflecting the projectiles,_ He asked the Magus.

_Perhaps you should have thought of that before you started marching,_ The Magus hissed.

_Well, pardon me for being slow to adjust to suddenly being given command!_

After a few angry comments back and forth, they came to a plan that seemed sound enough to Sycamore. He turned to his squad. “When the arrows start flying,” He called, his voice barely audible over the footfalls of the army, “We’ll take it in shifts. Throw your wind at them until you start to feel tired, then move to the next speaker. Do not exhaust yourself on your first shift, we’ve got to keep up the wind until the armies clash.” The two others nodded in understanding, “If their volleys reach us, take shelter under the infantry’s shields.” He paused to exchange a question with the Magus. “I’ll start with the first shift. Speaker Ashwood, wait for me to signal your shift, and third will be Speaker Ivory.”

He felt like a fraud issuing the orders; he was simply repeating what the Magus whispered in his head. His mind was reeling, and he did not have the sense or the experience to think of anything better, so he would place his trust in the Magus’s wisdom.

_I hope your boasts of intellect are not lies,_ Sycamore sent, ignoring the Magus’s bitter response.

As he waited for the horn to blow again, signaling the archers to start skirmishing, he stared out at the Fireglass army. It was slightly uphill to Mistfield, and Sycamore could barely see the mass of enemy footmen over his army’s heads. He wondered what the enemy thought at this moment. Were they in a panic? They were outnumbered in front, outflanked to the rear. They could not flee for fear of fourteen hundred men crashing into their backs, but to fight was to embrace odds that did not favor them.

It occurred to him that they had a third option. They could surrender. He recalled Lupin describing his mother at the assault of their village, surrendering to save on bloodshed. Lupin had called it cowardice, but, Sycamore was sure that the lives she saved would not see it that way. In a way, it seemed sensible compared to the coming battle. But he knew that sense would not prevail at Mistfield.

_Sycamore! The wind!_ The Magus snapped in his mind. Jolted free from his speculation, Sycamore frantically looked around. The horn had not sounded, but in front of him he heard calls for shields. He looked to the sky, and saw hundreds of shadowed shafts, flying quickly towards them. In an instant he processed that the other army, with the higher position, had loosed the first volley. And he had yet to grab the wind.

With a deep, frantic breath, he felt at the wind around him. The air was restless with the morning warmth, and there was a light breeze that blew across the field, sending the grass dancing and lightly touching the paths of the arrows in the air. Sycamore felt that wind, convinced it to bend to his will and, with a jerk of his wrist, threw a powerful gust in a crosswind diagonally away from them.
	
He directed most of the force to the sky, but even where he stood, a powerful breeze blew at his back. His sleeves flapped, and he watched as the arrows above him seemed to slow in the air, veering off to the side as the gust bent them in their flights. With the sudden wind, most fell well short of the approaching Whitebrook army.

Breathing a shaky sigh of relief, he pulled back some of his strength, reducing the wind to a strong breeze at their backs. It was not nearly as powerful as the gust he’d used to slow the Fireglass arrows, but still it should be enough to give their own arrows some lift. A moment later, a horn sounded, and the skirmishing began in earnest.

It was slow, moving with the regular pattern of arrows raining down on them. Hundreds of the Fireglass soldiers had moved a good distance from their encampment to pelt the Whitebrook army on their approach. They would loose a volley and make a dash backwards, slowly retreating towards their army. Meanwhile, the Whitebrook archers stepped in front of their formations, shooting arrows to thin the Fireglass skirmishing formation. Whenever he saw the enemy’s arrows in the air, he would send a burst of wind to affect their trajectory. With a heavy crosswind, it was effective enough that they avoided most of the casualties of the skirmish.

After long moments of controlling the wind and disrupting several volleys, Sycamore started to feel the strain of his Speaking. Finally, he turned to Speaker Ashwood. She looked at him with troubled eyes. He nodded at her, and she returned the gesture. He kept his push on the wind until he felt her power brushing at the edge of his consciousness. With a relieved exhale, he released the wind, turning over his role.

Without the burden of controlling the wind, he was free to look around and assess their advance. They had made it about halfway from the command post, but things had slowed considerably once the arrows started flying. Most of the infantry held shields over their heads, and sycamore saw dozens of shafts jutting upward where a buckler had saved a soldier’s life. 

As they marched, the infantry chanted a melancholy rhythm, keeping the formation as they slowly pushed on to the chaos of battle. They moved and sung with a mundane persistence, pierced only by the rain of arrows, hundreds of dull noises of impact punctuated by sharp screams as shields splintered and men and women suffered for it. From the flanks, injured soldiers trickled out, limping along with an arrow in their leg or cradling a pierced arm as they made their way to the field hospital. They would miss the battle, but likely survive the day. Some were not so lucky. More than once Sycamore stepped over a corpse, pierced in the neck or chest by an arrow through a broken shield, dying amidst the formation. Some were crushed under the weight of dozens of ranks of soldiers who did not notice that they trampled the body of a former comrade. Nausea swept over him, but he had no time to focus on the horror.

He felt a tap on his shoulder, and he turned to see Speaker Ivory, looking at him with a strained expression. Sycamore nodded with a frown, reaching to grasp the wind and resuming his interference. The second time around, they were quite a bit closer to the enemy, and it required even more strength to the wind in order to disrupt the arrows. He strained at the edge of his power, forcing more and more speed to the wind. Before too long, he turned to Ashroot. She nodded at him, but her face was pale, her forehead sweaty. A moment later, she took the reins of the wind.

Immediately, Sycamore could feel the flow of air weaken around him. The breeze at his back was lighter, but more importantly, the gusts to pull the arrows aside were much weaker, and more and more arrows began to fall among the army. The sound was a hailstorm of metal on wood, and the screams of pain became a constant when the Fireglass arrows fell. Sycamore bit his lip as he looked at Ashwood.

_She cannot keep up,_ The Magus sent. A moment passed, and she desperately handed off the wind to Ivory. Sycamore swallowed heavily as concern began to rise that they would not have the endurance to persist all the way to the enemy forces. The army’s pace had begun to quicken as they drew nearer to the enemy, slowly gaining on the enemy skirmishers, but they were still easily a thousand paces out.

With Ivory in control, some of the strength returned to the wind, but that could not change that they were close enough now to the enemy archers that the arrows threatened even those at the back of the army. At the Magus’s suggestion, Sycamore called out an order, and they began to duck under the shields of the back rank when arrows fell. It was an odd thing, to huddle in a mass of men and women he didn’t know, hoping mutely that the shield above them wouldn’t shatter on impact and damn them to an early grave.

A few moments more and Ivory grunted a plea. Sycamore took control of the wind with a breath, sending a surge of power as he spotted the next volley through the gaps of the shields. It was a difficult thing, to maintain the focus to throw aside the arrows while remembering to hide himself. He felt sweat beading at his forehead from the exertion. His energy was quickly fleeing him. He held on for another moment to give Ashwood more rest, but soon turned to her with a grim nod. She had a glassy look in her eyes but he felt her connect to the wind without protest.

They were nearly there now, nearly close enough for the infantry to charge, but that meant that the arrows fell with even more lethality. Ashwood was struggling next to Sycamore. Her breath was ragged, and though she still managed to throw some wind at their arrows, her strength was weakening.

As she struggled to keep the wind up, her focus waned, and with a few slow steps, she drifted behind the back rank. He was about to call her forward when the next volley landed with a hundred wooden thunks and a piercing scream from Ashwood.

An arrow, fletched with black feathers, buried itself deep in her leg, leaving her screaming and bleeding behind the formation. It struck her in the thigh, and Sycamore knew on sight she would no longer be able to walk. He spun to Ivory, who had also paused in his marching to stare at Ashwood with dull horror.

“Get her to the hospital,” Sycamore barked, splitting his concentration to seize the wind.

“But-” the other speaker started, his eyes flicking between Ashwood and the army ranks.

“I’ll handle it,” Sycamore called, cutting him off, “Go!” Ivory looked at him for a short moment before finally nodding, turning to help the still-screaming Ashwood off the ground and back to the hospital. Sycamore mentally urged them to move with haste. He did not want them to be stuck full of holes after retreating on his orders.

He hunkered under the shields of the infantry, his eyes glued to the skies. The arrows came, and Sycamore heaved his arm forward, throwing his strength into the breeze. In the back of his mind, he felt mute satisfaction as he watched the arrows turn in the air, but he did not have to freedom to register such emotions.

They were closer now, within a few hundred paces of the enemy army. The volume of the chants increased, drowning out the thumping of Sycamore’s heart. They began to move faster, their strides lengthening as anticipation rose. Sycamore tore at the arrows in the air with as much shear force as he could muster out of the wind.

A few more volleys, and the rhythm of the arrows changed. Rather than in waves, the came in a constant stream, slamming into the army like razor droplets dripping from the leaves of a tree.

_The enemy archers have rejoined their forces,_ The Magus sent, processing what Sycamore couldn’t in his focus, _They’re done with retreating volleys, they’re loosing at will, now._

Sycamore gritted his teeth. He was already straining himself with his gusts of wind. To keep it up persistently would push him to his limit. 

_I’m going to throw myself into this,_ He told the Magus, _I’ll stay on the rear rank, but keep watch to make sure I don’t accidentally march into the fray._ He did not wait for a response, and, with a deep, shaking breath, leaned into his speaking.

The wind came as a squall behind him as the threw the weight of his strength at it, used whatever poise and power he had to lead the wind forward and push aside whatever the Fireglass threw at them. He bit at his lips from the strain of it, tasting blood as his head pulsed with an exhausted pain. He had never used his Speaking like this, not with such strength, not for so long. But still, he continued to push forward and force the Fireglass arrows away from them.

He felt himself moving forward with the rest of the army, gaining speed as they slowly broke into a jog. He hardly felt his legs as he coaxed more power into his Speaking. The wind had started to protest. It did not like to be driven so hard, so long in one direction. It wriggled like a fish in his grip, trying to shake free, but he held on with every bit of his strength, fearing to see other trampled corpses, other stuck comrades.

Finally, the Magus spoke to him, _They’ve broken into a charge, Sycamore. It’s enough._

The sudden quiet as he released the wind was a shock to him, the roar of the wind replaced by the yells of soldiers as they dashed to clash with the other army. He watched with morbid fascination as the two armies finally collided. There was a crush of flesh and metal and steel and bone as screams and yells dominated the air. From where he stood downhill behind the army, he could hardly see the front, but what glimpses he got were of swords being buried in flesh, bloodstained metal, and men and women falling as they screamed their last words. He shuddered with deep nausea as his head throbbed with the pain of overexerting himself.

He stood watching the battle unfold mutely, and soon a trickle of injured soldiers, walking or being carried by comrades, began to move past him. He stared at them for a moment before it occurred to him that he could be of some use. He would not charge the front lines, but Ashwood and the other injured could use his help.

-----

The field hospital had moved closer to the battlefront, close enough that the roar of the fighting could be heard. A handful of surgeons and nurses were attending dozens of soldiers. A tent was being erected hastily, but until then the wounded sat about on the ground or lay on cots, moaning and writhing over their injuries until someone attended them. The armies had just clashed, and most of the injured were from the skirmishes, so all around were men and women, punctured by arrows. He spotted Ashwood and Ivory quickly enough among the throng. 

Ivory sat staring at the other speaker with a pale face, idly scratching at his neck. Ashwood lay sprawled on a cot. Someone had cut the cloth away from her wound, but the arrow remained buried deep in her thigh. Where it wasn’t covered in blood, her skin looked pale around the wound. Sycamore gingerly stepped around other injured soldiers, approaching his squad.

“Speaker Ivory,” Sycamore said when he drew close.

“Hmm? Oh,” Speaker Ivory said, looking up at Sycamore. He hadn’t noticed him, “Speaker Sycamore. Are you-” A panicked expression came to his face as he looked Sycamore over for a wound.

Sycamore waved a hand, “No, no, I came to find you once our job was done.” He stepped closer, kneeling down over where Ashwood lay, “Have any of the surgeons looked at her yet?”

Ivory shook his head, “A nurse came and assessed the wound, but decided her life wasn’t in danger, so it could wait.” His tone was bitter. “She did warn us that they may have to amputate the leg, though.”

Sycamore frowned, looking closer at the wound. After a moment, he shook his head. “No, they won’t have to. The arrows deep enough that it must have missed the bone. The arrowhead is likely barbed, so we can’t pull it out. We’ll have to push it through and snap off the head before we get the rest of the arrow out.”

Ivory blinked, giving him a confused look, “Push it through – are you a surgeon?”

Sycamore sighed. It was almost comforting to know that his reputation had not spread far enough that Ivory knew of his healing. “I’m a healer,” He said, “Now help me quickly, and we can get Speaker Ashwood fixed up.”

“I’m not sure-” Ivory started, but Sycamore was already moving, turning Ashwood onto her side. The woman protested briefly, but stopped as Sycamore whispered some comforting words to her.

“Here,” Sycamore said, “Hold her leg. Speaker Ashwood, this is going to hurt. Put a sleeve in your mouth so you don’t bite your tongue.” The woman mutely complied, and Ivory, sputtering a protest, nevertheless moved to follow his instructions.

When both were in position, Sycamore grasped the shaft of the arrow. Even touching it brought a wriggle of pain from Ashwood. Sycamore looked at Ivory with a dark look, “This will be much less painful for her if you make sure she doesn’t move.” The man, eyes wide, nodded, and Sycamore looked back to the wound. “I’m going to push the arrow through now. I’ll snap the head off and pull it out, quick as I can.” He heard Ashwood grunt and, taking that as confirmation, began.

With a strong, consistent movement, Sycamore pushed the arrow. Using one hand to steady what movement Ivory couldn’t, he pushed until the saw the tip pressing against her skin on the other side of her leg. Another push and the arrowhead popped out with a tear of flesh and a gush of blood. Pushing it a bit more, Sycamore pulled his knife from his waist and, bracing the shaft of the arrow with the blade of his knife, snapped off the arrowhead. Discarding the piece of metal, he pulled the arrow back through the wound, doing his best to ignore the grunts of pain and jerks of the leg. Soon enough, the arrow was free, and immediately Sycamore reached out with his Healer’s touch. He found Ashwood’s soul quick enough and, with a quick, careful movement, pulled her soul to the wound, watching carefully as the flesh knitted itself together. 

When the wound had closed, Sycamore leaned back, vainly trying to wipe his bloody hands on the ground. “There you go, Speaker Ashwood, good as new. Any splinters left in your leg should dissolve soon enough , so don’t worry about that.” Ashwood and Ivory looked at him with wide, shocked eyes. After healing so many, he’d become used to it, and he barely noticed their expressions. “Now go, see if you can be of use somewhere. There’s many injured about, and I have work to do.”

-----

With Ashwood healed, Sycamore moved to find others in need of his help. The battle yet continued, and more and more wounded found themselves to the field hospital. Quickly enough, Sycamore realized the nurses were sorting the injured into three groups. First were those who would be fine for hours without treatment, like Ashwood. They were shuffled to the side to wait until the surgeons and nurses were less busy. Second were those in need of immediate care; those who would not survive the day without the attendance of a surgeon. They were brought into the large tent where the surgeons carried out their business.

Finally, and most grimly, there was a wide stretch of cloth where those who were too far gone were brought. Nurses filtered among them, offering water or food, whatever comfort they could give to men and women on death’s door. Sycamore set his jaw, moving quickly towards this third group.

The first man he came across had been stabbed in the stomach. He bled dark, foul-smelling blood from his wound, and even if it was closed, it would fester with infection until the man died a painful death. He was pale in the face, he knew his fate. Shaking hands covered his wounds and he muttered nonsense to himself.

“Move your hands,” Sycamore said, kneeling down next to him. The man looked to Sycamore with crazed eyes; his pupils were dilated with shock, and he did not respond. With a grunt, Sycamore pried the man’s hands from his stomach. He looked at the wound quickly and, with a short burst of power, healed it in a moment. The man’s muttering ceased as the prodded at his stomach, slowly realizing he was not about to die. He started to give thanks, but Sycamore had already moved on.

Sycamore moved from soldier to solder, tasting bile as his nausea built. The air was full of smells of blood and sick and feces, and each wound had a slightly different reek. A man sputtered blood, his lungs filling from a wound. After Sycamore’s healing he would continue to cough blood for a while, but he would survive. A woman had been nearly scalped, blood where where a portion of her face had been sliced off with a section of her hair. She would wear a scar for the rest of her life, but her life would continue. A man had been sliced across the abdomen; his intestines spilled out like bloody eels onto his legs. It looked vile and smelled worse. With a careful movement, Sycamore stuffed the tubes back into the man, retching as he sealed the wound. He drew a wrist across his face to wipe away the vomit, knowing he smeared blood on a cheek. He moved on.

Eventually, the nurses began to notice his work, bringing those who were closest to death for him to heal. They brought him a man who had been cut through the armpit, but Sycamore shook his head. His lips were blue, and his wound no longer bled. It was too late for him.

A crowd gathered, too, those he had healed and those who simply wished to watch as he moved from person to person, ignoring his building headache and the layers of blood and grime that covered him. At some point, the smells blurred in his mind into the familiar smell of death. He vomited again, but nothing came up.

_Sycamore_ The Magus sent, his voice colored with worry or irritation or some other emotion Sycamore did not have time for. He ignored it, knowing the Magus would tell him not to exert himself, warn him of the attention he drew. He did not care. People were dying, and he could help.

Sycamore came upon a woman, the bones in her hand crushed to pulp and a deep cut across her chest. Looking at her soul, Sycamore knew she did not have the energy to heal both of the wounds. He healed the cut on her chest. Her hand would never recover, but she would survive.

“Sycamore,” A voice said. Was it the Magus again? No, but Sycamore still did not care. His head throbbed, aching pain, and the people he healed started to blur.

There was a man, a deep cut in his thigh, the bone broken from the wound. An axe or a heavy sword must have struck him. He muttered pleas for forgiveness, but his voice was weak. He had bruises on his head, spread darkly where part of his hair was shaved. Sycamore looked at his wounds. He was on the brink of death, but likely still had enough energy to seal the cut. Fearing the man would die if any more time passed, Sycamore pulled what little energy remained in his soul to heal the wound. 

Sycamore blinked. Something was wrong. He pulled the soul, but the wound did not heal, the energy went to – Sycamore looked up at his body. He wore a shirt, but underneath his ribs must be broken. Sycamore imagined it in his mind, he was trampled after he fell, stepped on before he was pulled from the fray. The man pleaded, desperately, for forgiveness, for aid, for something. Sycamore cursed under his breath, adjusting his healing, but the man’s soul was so weak. Sycamore pulled the lingering threads, trying desperately to close the wound on his leg, stem the bleeding. In a shocking moment, the man suddenly clutched at Sycamore’s wrist, and Sycamore realized with horror that there was no energy left in his soul. The man died there, in front of him, as Sycamore failed to heal him. He should have checked the man’s injuries, made sure nothing would divert the flow of magic. It was his fault the man was dead. 

For a third time, Sycamore turned to the side and retched. His throat burned from the action, dry heaving as nothing came up. The man’s hand was still on Sycamore’s wrist, and Sycamore clutched it, whispering a prayer of forgiveness, a plea that he would find rest in death. Sycamore’s head throbbed with pain, so he hardly noticed that there was something odd about the man’s hand. Something brushed at his memory, and he looked down at the hand. Two fingers were missing. Eye’s widening, Sycamore looked up to the man’s face. His hair was shaved on one side, and a tattoo spiraled around his ear. His face was pale, limp in death, but Sycamore recalled his sneer, the way he’d looked as he demanded Sycamore’s purse. Mastiff.

“Sycamore!” A voice cried, and Sycamore turned to see Lupin standing over him with a troubled look on his face. Why was Mastiff here, dead, on the ground in front of him? Had he joined the army, to fight for his land? “By the stormy skies, Sycamore, what happened to you?” Lupin said, grabbing Sycamore by the shoulder and roughly pulling him to his feet.

Sycamore’s eyes were glued to Mastiff’s face. He tried to pull away from Lupin’s grip, but was shocked to find himself weak. “I have to heal these people, they’ll die without me,” Sycamore pleaded. There were still wounded men and women around, people who needed him.

“Pike was right, you’ve no sense,” Lupin said, throwing an arm around Sycamore and pulling him along. Sycamore continued to struggle, and Lupin turned to face him with a sad frown, “You look like you swam through a lake of blood and bile, Sycamore. You’ve done enough. You cannot overexert yourself here, we need you when we go to free our clan.”

Sycamore’s mind froze at that comment, and he finally recalled where he was, what he was doing. His head ached terribly, and he tried to remember how many he had healed since coming to the hospital. It was a blur, punctuated by the shock of seeing Mastiff’s face. He wondered what had driven the man to join the army, how they had ended up as comrades on the battlefield.

Sycamore stopped his struggling, and allowed himself to be led away by Lupin, he turned to the other boy, his fellow Heartwood, his friend. “Lupin,” He said, “Do you remember what my mother always used to say, about old enemies?”

Lupin did not look at him as they walked, but he finally nodded, “They’re just future friends, right?”

“Right,” Sycamore said. He wondered whether he could have ever been friends with Mastiff. A wave of grief crashed into Sycamore, that he could not save Mastiff, that others would die without his aid, and he was suddenly weeping as he and Lupin walked away from the death behind them.
