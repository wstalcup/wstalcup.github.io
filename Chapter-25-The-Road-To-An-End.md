_Weeks of meandering along the frontiers, and my curiosity was finally outpaced by my desire for a proper bed. When I asked my companion, she, too desired to return to the kingdoms. The boy was similarly enthusiastic, though not with a homesickness but a curiosity, a want of new things. I looked forward to seeing his reactions to the home that had cast me off._

An Excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

Lupin caught the swing on the flat of his sword, easily deflecting the force to the side. With a retreating step, Perch attacked again, stabbing twice as she put some distance between her and her opponent. Seizing the momentum, Lupin batted her sword aside, stepping forward to aggressively test her defenses. She caught the first two swings, but on the third Lupin twisted the blade out of her hand with a deft movement.

Disarmed, she raised her hands in surrender. Lupin smirked broadly at her before turning to Pike. “That’s three for me, and you’re up next, Woolhead.” Pike grumbled softly as he stepped up, clutching his favored spear and one hand and swinging the other in a stretch.

“He’s gotten better,” Perch said to Granite and Sycamore who sat nearby, watching the training.

“They both have,” Sycamore commented, watching as Pike and Lupin began their spar. There was an air of ferocity and caution, balanced on the edge of a blade. Pike’s face lacked its common cheer, a grimace of effort in its place. Lupin, meanwhile, nearly sneered at the fight, his characteristic aggression plain in his actions. Their poise and focus was nothing like he remembered from their spars in the garden at Whitebrook.

“It’d be impossible not to, training like that,” Granite grunted with a shake of his head. There was an explosion of movement as Pike swung his spear to prevent Lupin’s approach. Never deterred, Lupin guarded with his sword while stepping forward to get within Pike’s comfortable range. Pike suddenly twisted his wrist, catching Lupin’s blade on the haft of his spear and pressing forward with a surge of strength. Lupin was the stronger of the two, but he was on his back foot and could not match the leverage of Pike’s position.

In a desperate move, Lupin let the attack slide through, catching the force across his torso as he slid his sword along the haft, dragging it across Pike’s hands. There was a yell of pain and a sound of impact as both lost hold of their weapons and fell to the ground.

“That’s my-” Lupin started, pausing with a wince as he hugged an arm across his ribs, “my win!”

“I believe that last blow must have robbed you of your wits,” Pike said as he eyed his fingers. Two of them twisted off at unnatural angles. “You got me in the hand, but I hit your ribs.” He turned to the spectators, “Sprout, I’m going to need your help. I don’t believe my fingers are supposed to twist like this.”

“And me after him,” Lupin said, “that last one cracked one of my ribs.”

Sycamore sighed as the rose to his feet. “You realize this training is a means to an end, right? What good will my healing be if your essences are too drained from training injuries by the time we confront the Fireglass?” He approached Lupin first, checking for any extra damage before he healed the wound in a moment.

“I’m sorry, Sprout,” Pike said, “It’s hard to stop-” He cut off with a yelp of pain as Sycamore set the broken bones back to their proper positions. A moment later the healing was finished and he continued, “hard to stop myself from going at it with such effort. We don’t know what awaits us, and all I have to bring is my skill with the spear.” Pike smiled apologetically at Sycamore, and he had nothing to do but sigh at his friends’ determination.

_They’re obsessed,_ He sent as Pike and Lupin, newly healed, began to bicker over who won the spar before finally agreeing to fight once again as a tie-breaker. There was a fervor to the way they came at the training, a desperation that accepted nothing less than full effort.

_And what of yourself, Sycamore? Is what they do much different than your own training?_ Sycamore grunted quiet acquiescence as he wove strands of wind about himself, wrestling for finer and finer control of his power. It was draining and obvious to train with huge gusts of wind, but with this narrow focus, he could go for hours without rest.

_I suppose it comes down to what you wish to call it,_ Sycamore sent as he rejoined the spectators, watching the second round of the spar, quickly won by Pike after Lupin overextended himself on a feint. _Call it obsession, call it drive to a goal that we’ve spent too long pursuing to approach with anything less than the full measure of our efforts._

There was a pause in the training as Juniper strode into the camp, a young buck thrown over her shoulder. She trained in her own way, spending the evenings in the wilderness hunting. Juniper’s return signaled the unofficial end of their time to train, and they quickly made camp as the girl skinned and butchered the animal for dinner. It was a relief, after army rations, to have someone like Juniper to provide them with filling meals. They needed as much energy as they could get.

_Do you believe yourself ready?_ Sycamore paused at the question, gnawing on the venison. It was greasy and gamey, somewhat stringy but fiercely satisfying.

_I don’t know. I’d like to believe that with our arrival with weapons we can hand things over to Jackdaw and my mother to lead the escape, but I know that is naïve. My strength in Speaking has grown, yes, but is it enough?_

_There is always my suggestion._

_As we discussed, I’ll keep it as a last resort. But I still worry over the risks, especially after Mistfield._

_Mastiff was on death’s door. Ideally that would not be the case._

_I know. Still..._ Images forced their way into Sycamore’s head of Mastiff’s ruined leg, cut not quite sealed before he ran out of strength. His pale face, muttered apologies fading on his lips as he breathed his last. Sycamore forced himself to swallow his mouthful of food, pausing a long moment to clear his mind before he took another bite.

-----

Sycamore felt his boots slipping in the mud as he heaved the rear of the cart, pushing with whatever meager strength he had to get the wheels out of their rut. Next to him, Pike grunted in effort as he leaned his shoulder into the wooden frame. Slowly, with the reluctance of a stubborn ox, the cart began to inch forward. Throwing as much strength as he could at the thing, Sycamore felt a burst of satisfaction as the wheels, with a defiant slurp, pulled themselves free from the mud and began to roll again normally. With a relieved sigh, Sycamore moved to rejoin the others in front of the cart as they continued their slow march to the prison camp.

Things had moved relatively quickly for the first two days. They’d stayed on the road, and, even with the mule and its cart, they’d kept the pace they wanted. After the second day, the road had veered south and could no longer be used. Additionally, that second night there’d been a downpour that saturated the land and made for slow movement from the third morning. And again on the third evening, rains had softened the ground.

As a result, what was supposed to be one day off the road had turned into three slow, muddy, arduous days of travel. Finally though, as their patience reached its limits, they were drawing near to the prison camp if Lady Marigold’s map was to be trusted. Juniper, taking the extra time of their approach to get a good lay of the land, had spotted signs of foraging that morning and, after warning the others, went off to follow the trail and see if it led to the Heartwood prisoners. Sycamore was anxious thinking about it, but was distracted enough by the uncooperative cart that her return surprised him.

She found them as they rested after navigating the cart through a particularly irritating ditch. 
Her face was flush with emotion; excitement and something else, concern, Sycamore thought. She rejoined them at a quick jog, pausing to catch her breath before she spoke.

“It’s them,” She said, “Just over an hour straight to the west of here, if we cut a good pace. A rough palisade around a camp – I didn’t get a good look inside, but I saw their faces. The Heartwood. Our clan.” There was a pause as they processed her words, and then a sudden burst of questions from each of the Heartwood members.

“Did you see Jackdaw or my mother? Were they healthy?”

“Lotus and Lily, or my father, did you catch sight of them?”

“What of my brother? Was Trout smiling?”

Juniper’s eyes widened, waving a hand to silence the rest. “I didn’t get more than a glance at some of the Heartwood foragers – folk sent out to scavenge for food I figure. They looked tired and hungry, but they were on their feet. Of your families, I don’t know, but I can tell you that I recognized who I saw. I kept myself hidden because I wanted to make a plan before we reveal ourselves, but we did it. We’re here.”

Sycamore felt a surge of emotion, anticipation and joy and longing to sprint to find his brother and mother. “We did it,” He echoed.

“We’re here,” Pike added.

“It’s time to end this,” Lupin said, the genuine joy in his voice ruining the intensity of his sneer.

They spent the evening finding a secluded spot to make camp. The prison camp was located in the foothills of the Redrock Mountains, and they searched between the hills for a suitable spot. They found a dry area, hidden in the shadow of a steep cliff, and tucked the cart in a rough jumble of bushes. They were close to the camp now, close enough that a ranging enemy scout could easily find them with any effort. Caution warred with excitement, but sensibility dictated that it would be a waste of their efforts to be spotted out after coming all this way. The only way they would succeed in their plan was with surprise; they could not afford to lose their sole advantage due to carelessness.

After making camp, they planned late into the evening, sitting in a loose circle around a fire. Lupin, of course, favored aggression, but his plans were senseless, relying more on emotion than tactics.

“We need more information,” Sycamore said sullenly in a lull of their argument. They’d somehow managed to convince Lupin that attacking that night was not, in fact, the plan with the highest chance of success.

“I can continue to scout,” Juniper offered, “get a good idea of the schedule of the camp and maybe the number of guards.”

“That would be helpful,” Granite said with a nod, “I’m not general, but even I know that when walking into odds like these, the more you know of the enemy’s forces, the better.”

“What about the foragers?” Perch added, “You said some of your folk were out when you made your approach to the camp?”

“That’s something I don’t understand. If they’re released every day to forage, why have some not run off?” Pike asked.

“From the look of those I saw, the foragers were mostly the young and old, those who couldn’t survive alone in the wilderness for long,” Juniper explained.

Sycamore grunted understanding. “Remember when we tried to make it on our own as boys, Pike? Our grand plan to make our own village free of the rules of our parents lasted until we realized how little we knew of survival. We moped home with empty stomachs before too long.” 

“Grab one of the foragers, then,” Lupin said, “They’ll happily give us information. Anyone with half a head about them will understand in rough numbers how many guards there are.”

“And after a month of living here, they should have a good understanding of the layout of the camp,” Granite said, scratching at the scruff on his chin, “I agree, get one of them for information.”

“Can you handle this alone, Juniper?” Sycamore asked, “I’d offer to help, but I don’t trust my abilities as a woodsman enough not to accidentally wander into one of the guards.”

She nodded emphatically, “I can do it. My father taught me to sneak up on a fox, and I’ve never met a person with half their awareness.”

“I trust you,” Pike said with an easy smile, and Sycamore nodded his agreement.

“We’ll go with that, then,” Perch said, “Take a day to get a grasp of their schedule, then pluck one off for questioning. We’ll make more specific plans from there.”

Lupin frowned, “It’s a sound enough plan, but it’s going to grate to just sit and wait when our destination is so close. What are the rest of us supposed to do?”

“Prepare ourselves,” Granite said darkly, “We don’t know specific numbers, but the intelligence we were given puts the Fireglass numbers in the hundreds. Even with the weapons we’ve brought, we can arm no more than fifty. In the best case, our odds are going to be ugly.”

“That’s true, but there’s no point in scaring ourselves until we have the full details,” Sycamore added, more to reassure himself than anything else. The others nodded, but sycamore recognized the grim cast to their expressions. Granite’s words had reminded them that this was not going to be easy, pulling their clan out of the fire.

_Do you have anything to add?_ Sycamore asked the Magus as the rest readied to sleep. He would take the first watch; it would be a good time to practice his speaking.

_The plan seems sound enough, and Granite has it right about your odds, but I’m surprised no one made mention of the condition of your clan. You’re here, yes, and Juniper has seen the Heartwood, but are you sure that the rest will be healthy enough to fight back, even if you arm them?_

Sycamore clenched his jaw, _I assure you the state of our clan has left none of our minds. But you cannot expect us to boldly put forth that our families may be injured or dead._

There was a pause before the Magus responded, _Of course, I apologize. I forget, sometimes, that this is more than a task to be completed for you, more than a goal with no consequence of failure._

_It’s all right. I ask you for counsel, and giving voice to uncomfortable thoughts is part of that. I simply hope your concerns are unnecessary._

_If it is any consolation, I hope the same._

Sycamore felt himself smiling silently at the Magus’s concern. _Then let’s pray our hopes are vindicated._

-----

Worry surged when Sycamore saw Juniper return breathless, worry that somehow she’d been spotted and their plan foiled before it even began. The others were doing their best to pass the time, training or foraging or talking over plans. Naturally, her return put a halt to that, brought them around her waiting for her report. Sycamore’s worries did not last, as it only took a moment for him to see that she was not upset, but rather excited.

“The guards,” She started, breaking off into eager breaths. When she regained her composure, she tried again, “The guards, around a hundred of them marched off to the north.”

“What? Why?” Lupin asked.

“Could they be drilling?” Pike added.

Juniper shook her head slowly, “I don’t know why, but I don’t think they’re off to drill. They carried with them packs, too big for a day trip.”

“And you said there were a hundred?” Granite asked, “A hundred soldiers just left?”

“I – I can’t be sure of the numbers, but around a hundred, yes. They left to the north.”

“Should we expect them back soon?” Perch asked, “Or should we make plans to attack the camp soon?”

“If it’s a chance, we must take it,” Lupin said, eagerness creeping into his voice.

Sycamore gnawed on his lip as the thought over this development. His eyes widened when it occurred to him, and he smiled broadly at Juniper.

“I believe,” He said, “That even here, days away, your aunt continues to give us gifts.”

Juniper’s eyebrows raised, “You think they’re off to address the Whitebrook army?”

“Just a hundred of them?” Perch added.

Sycamore shrugged, “It makes sense to me. We trounced them at Mistfield and I don’t expect Lady Marigold would be content with that. Any sensible leader would pull troops from where they’re available. The Fireglass seem to think that those hundred are unnecessary here.”

Lupin grinned, “We’ll just have to prove them wrong, then.”

“I hate to owe her more, though,” Sycamore added, thinking of Lady Marigold’s offer. He had yet to tell the other Heartwood about the agreement she’d proposed. It was a concern for after their clan was free.

“I’ll take any help we can get,” Granite said, “If they sent off a hundred, there must be at least that many left. Still, one hundred is better than two hundred.”

“So does this change our plans?” Pike asked, bringing a thoughtful pause to the conversation.

Sycamore frowned, hesitantly speaking, “I think... I think no. If I’m right then they’ll be gone for a long while. A few more days won’t change that.”

“If you’re wrong we could be wasting our chance,” Perch pointed out.

“If he’s wrong, we’re saving ourselves from walking into an outnumbered fight with reinforcements potentially joining halfway through,” Granite said, “I agree with Sycamore, we should continue as usual.”

“I’ll trust whatever you all decide,” Pike said, Juniper nodding agreement. They turned to Lupin. He was the hardest sell for caution. 

Finally, he nodded, “We’ve got one shot at this, and I’d rather not squander it with carelessness. When we free our clan, we’ll do it with aggression and vengeance and proper ferocity. But we’ll also do it with a solid plan.”

“That’s a rare change of perspective,” Pike said, echoing Sycamore’s thoughts. It was far more measured than he’d come to expect of Lupin.

Lupin flushed at the comment, glaring at Pike, “Pardon me for being enthusiastic about saving our clan,” He paused to look at the ground, scratching at his head almost skittishly, “I just – I just have come to realize that this will be the end of it, one way or another. Either we succeed and manage to free everyone, or we fail and end up captured with the rest, or something worse. It would be a shame, a betrayal to those who wait for our aid, to do anything less than our best.”

There was a long pause before Sycamore felt himself snickering, “could you tell that to yourself of a month ago? I suspect he’d take issue with your words and there’d be an historic brawl.”

Lupin glared at him, “Careful, runt. I know you can’t heal yourself, but I’ve seen how well you can push through bruises.” Before they’d begun this long journey together, that comment would have caused Sycamore pain, sent him shaking and resentful. Now, though, with the friendly tone and the absurd circumstances, he couldn’t help from laughing. Lupin was soon laughing with him, in excitement or self-deprecation, it didn’t matter.

When their giggles had subsided, Granite spoke, wearing a small smile of his own, “Tomorrow then, we grab a forager, and things begin in earnest.”

-----

They hunched low, silently waiting in the brush for any sign of Juniper. They’d left just after sunrise, staking the mule by a stream and leaving the cart unguarded. Briefly, Sycamore had worried after some passerby stumbling upon the weapons, but they were so far from any town or village that he knew there was nothing to worry on.

“How long do you expect it’ll take her to snatch one away?” Pike asked from where he sat on the ground, drawing lines in the dirt with the haft of his spear. They’d all brought their weapons, just in case somehow they were found by the Fireglass. It was a last resort, a worst case scenario, but, as close as they were to the prison camp, they would not be caught defenseless.

“You know as well as the rest of us,” Granite grunted. 

“We’re trying to keep our presence a secret, else I imagine it would be easier to pull one away,” Sycamore said. It felt somehow wrong to keep their movements hidden. He wondered what his mother and Jackdaw thought of his circumstances, what they thought he was up to. He wanted to go to them, to tell them he was alive and well, here to help them and go home together. But he could not do so. The moment would come soon, but not yet.

Sycamore heard the sound of rustling in the brush and he reached out to the wind. There was a tense moment before a sigh of relief when he spotted Juniper through the trees, a young boy walking behind her. He smiled in recognition. It was a surreal feeling to see another member of their clan, but he expected what he felt was nothing compared to another.

“Lotus,” Lupin said softly, recognizing his brother behind Juniper.

Juniper came up on them with a smile on her face. “We have an hour,” She said, “Any longer than that and we risk someone noticing his absence.” They were hardly paying attention to her, as before she even finished speaking, Lupin had dashed to his brother, wrapping him with a tight hug, tears streaming down his face.
