_As we drew closer to the borders of the kingdoms, there was a change in attitude in the boy. He seemed to grow anxious, nervous in a way I hadn’t expected. When I asked him about his mood change, he answered that he was worried he would be treated as an outcast for his upbringing. It was a humorous reminder of the boys youth, and I assured him that he did not have to reveal his Halfling upbringing if he did not want to, and if he did, it would only make him unique. He smiled at that, saying that after so much preparation and anticipation, it would be a shame if things went poorly._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

When Lupin and Lotus were calm enough to talk, enough time had passed that Sycamore began to worry whether they’d have the time to get an answer to their questions.

“Lupin,” He said with soft insistence.

Lupin tore his eyes from his brother, turning to look at Sycamore. There was a moment of eye contact before Lupin nodded roughly, turning back to his brother.

“By the sun and the sky, it’s good to see you, Lotus, but we have some questions,” He said.

“As do I! How did you survive? Lily and I – we thought – you were bleeding and – I’m sorry,” Lotus said, his voice breaking at the end.

“Woah, there,” Lupin replied, wry smile on his face, “You’ve no need to apologize for my own carelessness. That’s my own fault. Truthfully, I owe you an apology for how I let that Fireglass scum get one over on me. But don’t you worry, we’ll get our satisfaction.” He ruffled Lotus’s hair with a hand.

“You don’t have to apologize, either,” Lotus added, his eyes teary and wide, “how did you survive? We left you there, bleeding on the ground. I thought – thought you were-”

Lupin spoke up, cutting off Lotus before he could descend into hysterics, “Sycamore, luckily, found me before...” He coughed, “but that’s a conversation for later. I’m certain you have dozens of questions, but we have limited time, and we’re pressed for information.” He smiled fondly at his younger brother, “We’ve come, you see, to free you from the Fireglass, and only you can help us. Can you answer our questions, Lotus?”

Sycamore swallowed. It was a lot of pressure to put on the boy. He was several years younger than Pike, Sycamore, and Lupin, perhaps not old enough to shoulder such responsibility. Lupin, of course, knew his brother better, and after a moment of shock and indecision. Lotus’s expression hardened, and he answered with a nod.

“That’s it,” Lupin said with a smile. He turned to Sycamore with a small nod before looking back to his brother. “First off, how many Fireglass guards are there?”

Lotus’s brows furrowed as he thought, “Two hundred, I think. It’s the same group that attacked our village, mostly.” His eyes widened, “Half of them left yesterday! It’s – how could I forget? Our father, he and the others-”

Lupin squeezed his brother’s shoulder with a hand. “Slowly, Lotus, slowly. You said half of them left yesterday, so there are one hundred left? And what’s this about our father?” There was an edge of worry to his tone. 

“Yes, about a hundred, I think. And last night – a commotion woke me in the middle of the night, yelling and fighting, but Aunt Poppy warned us to stay inside and quiet. When we woke this morning, they were gone – Our father, and Jackdaw, and the others,” He glanced at Sycamore, whose expression had set grimly.

“My brother, is he okay?” Sycamore said, belatedly adding, “And your father, of course.”

“I – I don’t know,” Lotus said, frowning, his voice shaking, “They told us they were going to hold them until they learned what happened, but the sounds, yells and wind – it reminded me of the attack.” He was shaking, his face pale and his eyes wide. He was haunted.

Lupin wrapped his brother in a hug, shushing him with a glare for Sycamore. He shrugged apologetically. He hadn’t meant to set the boy off, but his question may have been too intense.

“Don’t worry about father, he’s a strong man,” Lupin said as he released his brother. With renewed calm, the younger boy nodded. “Now tell me, what were the circumstances of their revolt? You said Aunt Poppy told you to stay inside and quiet, was she involved as well?”

Lotus shook his head, looking at Sycamore, “No, she wasn’t. She called it foolishness, said that their pride was wishing death on everyone. The older folk seemed to agree with her, but-” he broke eye contact with Sycamore, “But I don’t think my father would act for pride.”

Sycamore looked at the boy, and could not help but agree. His clothes were ragged, and his face was filthy and gaunt. The joy of the reunion had overshadowed his condition, but Lotus did not look like the healthy, confident boy from their village. He was worn down and skittish, like an old, mistreated dog. It was more than enough reason for action.

Sycamore turned to Lupin, and they shared a moment of intense eye contact. He could see the accusation in his friend’s eyes, the indictment of his mother’s inaction, but Sycamore was not ready to condemn her yet. He knew what she valued, knew her priorities were informed by years of combat and piles of bodies around her – he’d witnessed it, briefly, at the battle of Mistfield, and felt the change at his very core. She’d been steeped in that for decades.

Finally, Lupin turned back to his brother. “What about the other Heartwood folk, how are things with them? Have many – are things okay?” He said, stopping himself before he asked of the worst.

“We held on for a while, but It’s gotten worse in the past two weeks. Aunt Poppy would heal anyone who got injured, but now... She looks tired, in pain. We can’t ask her to heal us anymore, so things are getting worse. A few of the elderly have taken sick, are bound to their cots. There’s stress in the mines as they ask for more ore, but we don’t have any more workers,” He paused, “I think that’s why father attacked the Cinderwhip, he saw things were getting worse.”

Sycamore’s ears perked up at the mention of that name, “The Cinderwhip? They tried to attack her?” As the group’s only Speaker, it would be his responsibility to handle her, especially if things were as bad with Jackdaw and his mother as Lotus described. He had worried over as much, and Lupin’s descriptions of her flaming whips were always in his mind when he trained.

“Ah – I don’t know,” Lotus admitted, “But the next morning there was char on the ground, and one of the buildings was burnt. It’s – it’s what the others were saying.”

There was a pause as Sycamore lost himself imagining the fight, shuddering at the thought of being attacked by whips of fire.

Eventually, Juniper spoke from where she’d been silently watching, “Lupin, the map.”

Lupin turned to her with a nod. Pike brought from his pack their map and a stick of charcoal. It felt a shame to ruin the back of their map by scribbling on it with charcoal, but it was necessary. He stepped forward, silently handing them to Lupin.

Lupin turned back to his brother, “I know we’ve asked a lot of you, but there’s one more thing. We need a map of the camp: the walls, the buildings, guard patrols if you know them. As much detail as possible. Take your time, and do your best.” Lotus nodded firmly, and they knelt down together, spreading the map across a firm place on the ground. Slowly, but with growing confidence, Lotus started to draw.

_He weathers the pressure well, for one so young. A side effect, perhaps, of being caught in such trying circumstances,_ The Magus commented.

_I think he simply trusts Lupin enough to cast off his worries. You saw how unconfident he became whenever I asked a question. But, for Lupin, the answers came easily._ Sycamore wondered if he would act similarly, were he and Jackdaw in their positions. They were not in close, in age or relationship, but he wanted to think their trust extended as far.

They watched for a long while as Lotus slowly transferred his memories of the camp onto the map. Lupin and Juniper pressed him for more and more information, labeling the buildings as specifically as possible, noting wherever guards stood, in day or night. Lotus tried his best, but eventually, all their questions were met with confusion or the shake of his head. Finally, they were satisfied, delicately rerolling the map so as not to smear the charcoal and replacing it in Pike’s bag.

“Time is pressing,” Juniper said, “Too much longer and you’ll be missed.” She glanced at Lupin, “Say your goodbyes, I’ve got to get him back to the others.” Lupin nodded, hugging his brother again.

“I’ve missed you Lotus, and I’m so proud of you for helping us out,” He said, “But I have just one more request.”

“Whatever you need, Lupin.”

“You must keep this meeting a secret. We’re going to do something to help you, but we don’t know when we will act, and we don’t want them getting suspicious. You’re the only one who knows, and we want to keep it that way.”

Lotus paused a moment before replying, “Can I at least tell Lily? We blamed ourselves for your death. I – I don’t want her to have to feel that pain anymore.”

Sycamore saw Lupin’s eyes shut roughly, and when he replied it was strained, “No, do not tell her. Think of it as a surprise, if you must, but keep it a secret.” The hug ended and Lupin wore a confident smile on his face, but Sycamore could tell it was forced. He knew Lupin did not want to let Lotus leave, wanted his sister to know he yet lived, but in order for their plans to succeed, he had no choice.

A moment more, and Lotus nodded.

“There’s a strong boy,” Lupin said with a firm smack to his shoulder. Lotus winced at the movement but smiled widely. Juniper moved to lead Lotus off, but Lupin beckoned her to wait a moment more. “Now Lotus,” He said, “I know you’ve enjoyed being the eldest for a moment, but I’m back now. You’ve done a great job keeping things together while I was gone, but I’m here. Remember, keep this a secret, and wait for us. Time’s about to come for us to show them the strength of Rhubarb’s boys.” The last was said with a wicked grin, a hint of the violence they planned to bring.

A smile and wave for the other Heartwood folk, and Lotus was led off by Juniper. Sycamore could tell it pained Lupin to watch him leave, and when he was finally out of sight, Lupin’s face took on an angry, steely expression.

“Come now,” He said, turning to leave, “We have the map. Juniper knows where the camp is. We have plans to make.” With a brisk pace, he set off back to their camp. They had the information they wanted, all that was left was to make a plan and carry it out.

-----

By the time Juniper left to infiltrate the camp that night, they had mostly settled on a plan.

“So we agree then,” Granite said, studying the map, “The best places to cache the weapons are here, here, and...” He paused before tapping his finger on the map again, “Here.”

“I still think that they ought to be even closer to the walls – spare seconds could cost us when we’re trying to arm the prisoners,” Perch said, picking with a thumbnail at an insect bite while she studied the map. She looked up at Granite, cutting him off before he could protest, “but, as you said, we need to keep the weapons hidden until the attack itself, so yes, we agree.”

Sycamore watched them as they plotted, hunched over the map. They were far more experienced in combat, and thus took the lead with the formation of their plan. Still, they relied mostly on instinct and improvisation, as in their careers as merchant guards they never had assaulted a heavily armed prison camp or armed a prison revolt. Sycamore, for his measure, was lost in thought about his role in the attack. He had to create a large enough distraction to arm the prisoners and then face down the Cinderwhip. Hopefully, Jackdaw or his mother would have enough strength to help him, but if not, his Speaking would go toe-to-toe with hers. And he was not confident in that exchange.

“Are you okay, Sprout?” Pike asked. He, too, was watching Granite and Perch fuss over the map, though his role was comparatively simple.

“I’m fine. Just planning, thinking,” Sycamore replied. It would take a few days before they were able to stow the weapons for the assault. It was enough time for him to make a plan, prepare himself for the worst. Or, if he let himself slip, stew in his worries and insecurities.

“Don’t tie yourself into a knot with worry,” Lupin said, “We have every advantage that we need, surprise and weapons and grit and desperation.”

“Will those things work against the Cinderwhip?” Sycamore asked softly.

Lupin shrugged, “She’s one woman. Throw enough steel and wind at her, and she’ll break eventually.”

“Pa always said that even the sturdiest tree falls to the axe eventually,” Pike added.

“Are you sure I’m the axe in that metaphor, not the tree?” Sycamore replied with a wry smile.

“You are nothing there,” Lupin said with a frown, “We, however, are indeed the axe. You don’t have to face her alone, Sycamore.” He turned to the map, asking Perch and Granite over some detail of the attack.

_Ask him about the last resort._ 

_We can plan well enough that we don’t need it._

_Come now, Sycamore. You cannot put it off forever – we made this contract because you desired power, and you refuse to use the tools I’ve presented._

_I hoped the power you’d offer would come easier, with less danger._

_No power comes at no cost,_ The Magus sent with rare harshness. Sycamore blinked, caught off guard by the tone, but understanding it when he recalled his visions from when they’d bound their souls.

_You’re right, of course, but please don’t fault me for not wanting to take a risk that might yet be unnecessary._

Sycamore heard the Magus sigh through his soul. _Fine. But do not linger in denial if the time comes when you need that power. I might remind you that our bargain is yet unfulfilled, and I won’t have you dying before then._

_Do not worry, I have no plans of dying anytime soon._ Sycamore said with a small smile. The Magus dressed it with bravado and expectation, but it was hard to conceal emotions when speaking through the soul, and Sycamore could hear his thoughtful concern.

Suddenly, Juniper burst through the brush, her eyes alight with fear and concern. She searched the camp with a frantic gaze, her eyes settling on Sycamore.

“Juniper, what’s wrong?” Pike said, hopping to his feet, “Were you spotted?” He offered her a water skin and she took it with a grateful nod, taking greedy sips as she slowly regained her breath.

“What? No – not as far as I know. It’s Jackdaw,” She said between gasps and sips, “They plan to execute him in the morning.”

Sycamore felt his mind blank, a twist of shock and anxiety screwing itself into his heart. A hundred questions combined in his head, and he sputtered nonsensically for a moment before regaining his wits with a shake of his head, forcing order to the chaos her statement brought.

“Slower, Juniper, and more detail,” Granite said, carefully rerolling the map.

“My brother is to die tomorrow?” Sycamore said, “Then we must move, now.”

Juniper spoke in a rush, “I made it to the camp well enough, Lotus’s map proved quite accurate, and their security seemed to be focused inward as he said. No one was watching the exits, so I was able to slip right in.”

“My brother,” Sycamore demanded.

“Right. I stayed on the fringes, spot-checking Lotus’s map of the buildings. When I came to the Fireglass barracks, I overheard a bit of talking. It was banal stuff, mostly, normal drinking conversation, but in the end I heard them mention a plan for an execution. In the morning, to make an example of him for trying to revolt, Jackdaw is to be put to the axe.” Sycamore felt his jaw clench, his teeth grinding. Violent images of Jackdaw hanged or beheaded or burnt alive filled his mind, robbed him of his sense.

“And you made it away without being seen?” Perch asked.

Juniper nodded slowly, “I think so, yes. I kept quiet until I was out, and I don’t expect they have many guards where I could be spotted.”

“Enough of this!” Sycamore burst, “I don’t care about these details. My brother is to be executed, we must stop it!”

“Of course,” Granite said, “But our plan was–”

“The plan doesn’t matter now,” Pike said, cutting him off, “That’s Sprout’s blood, our clan’s head. We need to stop the execution before it happens.”

“Then let’s be off!” Sycamore urged.

“Calm yourself for a moment, Sycamore,” Lupin said, “Thoughtlessness will only get us all killed.”

Scyamore whirled on him, “How could you, of all people, ask for calm? What happened to your need for revenge? Finally, I’ve agreed, and you push me for caution? Have you lost your nerve, Lupin?”

Lupin glared at him. “You saw my brother, Sycamore. Do you understand the restraint it took for me to allow him to leave? To walk back to that place that has seen him waste away to that sorry state of hunger and weakness? We need caution, yes, because it’s not just our lives we’re putting on the line. Move too fast and you’ll just get yourself killed, get your brother killed!”

It took all Sycamore’s restraint not to tackle Lupin for suggesting he might have a hand in his brother’s death, even through carelessness, but he held back. He shut his eyes roughly, taking a few ragged, calming breaths. His heart was racing in his chest, adrenaline and instinct telling him that he needed to protect Jackdaw, but Lupin had the right of it.

“Fine,” He finally said when his nerves had calmed, “We take a moment to plan. But then we strike.”

Sycamore did his best to secure the weapons in his pack. It was overstuffed, heavy, and in any other circumstance he might worry over the strength of the leather. At the moment, he had no room in his mind. The night was clear, and his hands moved swiftly by the light of the stars.

“I still think I should-” Granite started. He was fidgeting over the map, indigence on his face.

“Enough,” Lupin said dismissively, “We’ve been over this, we need someone to stay behind, and you’re the best pick for it. You know these lands and will be able to guide whoever comes out best back to Whitebrook.”

“Besides,” Pike added, “It’s not really your fight, and it would not sit right with me if we led you to your death.” He had the heaviest burden to carry, the most weapons.

“I came to pay back my debt to you,” Granite said, “I don’t see how staying behind does so.”

“You’ve no debt to repay,” Sycamore said roughly. He was tired of discussing, tired of anything that was not moving to save his brother. In a moment of clarity, he realized this must have been what Lupin had felt like whenever he pushed for caution. There would have been humor in the observation if he wasn’t so desperate. “The reason you’re to stay behind is the same reason Perch is fighting with us. It’s the best chance for success.”

“I still owe you my life, Sycamore,” Perch said, “You could not keep me from the fight.” Her own pack, like Lupin’s, was light. She needed limberness to move at the start of the fight.

Sycamore huffed a sigh, but he was too anxious to protest over his healing and debts. Perhaps his mother could explain how these things work to Perch after they got her out. Apparently she did not understand that he required no debt, no matter how many times he said it.

“Fine,” Granite said finally, “I’ll guide them back. But you must swear you will succeed.”

“Do you suppose a promise would change our desire to succeed?” Lupin asked as he secured his own pack.

“No, but,” He turned to Perch, “Protect them. I forget it with Lupin’s thorny tongue, Pike’s height, and Sycamore’s mind, but they’re children.” 

“Whether we are children will have to wait for the end of the night,” Sycamore said, turning to the others, “For now, we need to move. My brother is waiting to die.”

“The night is young, there’s time for violence yet,” Lupin said, “But Sycamore has the right of it. We know the plan, know our roles and accept them – now that Granite has fallen into line – It’s about time we get things started.” He looked around to the others, “We’ve come a long way, and our families wait for us.” He turned to Sycamore, grinning wickedly, “Thanks again, Sycamore, for saving my life when this all started. If not for you, the chance to show this scum why it was a mistake to mettle with the Heartwood would never have come.”

“I’m glad,” Pike added with a somber smile, “That I am here to see this. I regretted it for a long while, letting Trout run off and leave me behind, but here, now, I know I owe him thanks. If not for him saving me back there, I couldn’t save him here. Pa always said that it isn’t how you start a job, it’s how you finish one that people remember.”

“I wish my father were here to see this,” Juniper said softly as she replaced the last arrow into her quiver after checking, “He was not so wise as Pike’s, but we could have used his bow.”

“I’m glad I met you folk,” Perch said, “Glad you allowed us to join you for dinner and fought with us.” She turned to Sycamore, “Glad I still live.”

“Good luck. I’ll make sure any who get out get back to Whitebrook safely,” Granite said.

“I did not realize this was the time for speeches,” Sycamore commented dryly, pulling his pack to his shoulders, “save them for when we return, with a bigger audience of friends and family. Come now, let’s finish this thing.”
