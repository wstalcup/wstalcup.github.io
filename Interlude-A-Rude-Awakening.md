Humor could be found, Jackdaw always thought, in the most unsuspecting of circumstances. A twist of wit, a betrayal of expectations, an unexpected pattern. He considered the ability to find humor in nearly any situation one of his greatest strengths. Looking around at the haggard, grim faces of his co-conspirators, he found little to laugh at.

Security in the labor camp was tight throughout the day. There were foremen in the mines and forges, watching with short tempers, waiting for Heartwood folk to lag in their work. At night, however, most of the soldiers retreated to their barracks to drink and dice, and unwatched movement became easier. Still, they were taking a hefty risk by meeting like this.

“Have you had any luck convincing Aunt Poppy?” said a voice in the darkness. They stood in a large shed, where piles of unprocessed ore would mute the sounds of their hushed conversation, but Jackdaw still winced at the boy’s volume, amplified by eagerness. Trout was the youngest member of their group. He’d followed his father to the second of their meetings, and they could hardly turn him away after he showed such enthusiasm. 

“Hush, boy,” Trout’s Pa hissed, “Or I’ll send you back to bed.” In normal circumstances, the comment would make Jackdaw laugh.

“No, my mother remains stubborn,” Jackdaw whispered, bitterly frowning into the darkness.

“Then we move on alone?” Said another voice, Swift, a vintner, “The elders will not be convinced unless Aunt Poppy gives the go-ahead.”

Jackdaw gnawed on his lip as he thought over the circumstances. Those who remembered the trek west, the time in the old Heartwood clan, were not eager to return to violent times. They would not put a foot forward in revolt if his mother did not lead them.

“I’ll speak to her again, see if she won’t see reason,” Jackdaw said, “but if she doesn’t…” His voice faded to uncertainty.

“We fight,” Said a stony, grim voice. Rhubarb had not been the same since Lupin was killed. The grief at losing a son had left him in a daze. But now, that daze had begun to fade, and it was replaced with a seething, burning rage.

“We fight,” Jackdaw confirmed, feigning confidence. He was the head of the Heartwood clan, but he knew better than any other that his position came more from his mother’s influence than the clan’s trust in him. With a shake of his head, he dismissed the thought. That did not matter. He would not sit and wait for his clan to wither under the whips of the Fireglass. Not while he still breathed.

He found his mother after the midday meal. They were herded into a fenced off area like livestock, given a gruel made from whatever the children and elders could forage in the forest at the foot of the mountain. It tasted vile, but he ate eagerly. It was not the cooks’ fault that they were given little more than a cauldron and a spoon and were expected to feed the entirety of the clan. Nor could he justify skipping a meal when his days were filled with the backbreaking labor of pulling iron from the earth. His hands ached from swinging a pick, and he had a persistent cough from constantly inhaling bits of stone and dust in the mineshafts. Normally, he would ask his mother to heal him. As it was, he could not do it.

His mother looked far older than he could ever remember. Dark rings surrounded her eyes, and her face sagged with exhaustion and age. Every day, she was made to heal whatever injuries came from the harsh labor of their prison camp, and every day, more came back with sprains and breaks. The Fireglass knew of her ability, used it as an excuse to drive the Heartwood folk halfway to death. He couldn’t help but seethe when he saw them snicker as they watched her heal. It pained him to see her exhausted smiles covering winces as she rubbed at her temples. She did not say it, but he could tell the pain from the healing became greater and greater as the days passed. He did not understand how she could be so unreasonable.

He approached her as she was speaking to one of the Fireglass guards. The man had a friendly smile on his face, and his mother laughed as she spoke to him. Jackdaw ground his teeth, not understanding how his mother, a woman of such strength and ferocity, could speak to the Fireglass no differently than old friends.

She broke off her conversation as he approached, waving at the guard as he wandered back to his post. She watched him leave with tired eyes.

“Mother,” Jackdaw said.

She turned to him in a slow motion. “My Nestling,” She said with a smile. Her brows furrowed when she noticed his frown. “What troubles you?”

“I’m no child, mother, so spare me the coddling. I don’t understand how you can speak to the guards so easily,” Jackdaw said, spite bleeding into his tone, “You’ve seen how they treat us. How can you chat and share jokes?”

Her smile faded as he spoke to a weary frown. “They treat us better here than at some labor camps I’ve seen,” She said stubbornly.

“Yet still, we’re treated worse than pack mules. Even the cruelest of farmers does not smile when his mule breaks a leg. How can you not see that?”

“We still live, Jackdaw.”

“And is that enough for you?” They stared at each other for a long, tense moment.

“What is this about?” His mother finally asked.

“I spoke to the others last night,” Jackdaw began.

“Not this foolishness again. I won’t have it,” She said, brushing a hand across her forehead to wipe at a bead of sweat.

“We cannot keep on like this. I thank the sun and the sky that none have died yet, but if the wind changes even slightly, bodies will start to pile up,” Jackdaw was careful to keep his tone low. He feared the consequences if a guard were to overhear.

“I’ve spoken to many of the guards. They don’t wish pain upon us, they are simply doing their jobs,” She said.

“And have you spoken to their taskmaster, the Cinderwhip? What does she think? Will she care when the old can no longer walk and start to drop dead? Will she hold back her whips when the ore comes slower, enough not to meet their demands?” Jackdaw stared his mother in the eyes, searching for the fire he knew she had in her. She cared too much of her people to be content with things as they are.

“The guard I was just talking with, his name is Sycamore,” She said softly.

Jackdaw felt an ugly expression twist his face. “Is that what stops you from recognizing this outrage? That one shares a name with my brother? I might remind you that no one knows what became of Sycamore after the attack. He could be dead.”

Suddenly her hand was on his shoulder, her grip iron. She had a fervor in her eyes, a lack of control he rarely saw in her. “Do not speak such ill omens. Sycamore yet lives. I know it.”

With a slow movement, Jackdaw pried her fingers from his shoulder, holding her hand in his. It was cold. “You’re right. I trust Sycamore. He’s a strong boy, and I know he will persist through whatever comes his way.” He squeezed her hand, urging some warmth into her old fingers. “I am not as smart as Sycamore, not as strong. I need your support mother, the clan does.”

She looked up at him, frailty and weakness lining her face. “What would you have me do, Jackdaw? Cast off the peace we’ve found here?”

“Can you truly call this peace?” His voice was barely above a whisper.

“We yet live, don’t we? How much violence would there be if we fought back, how many would die?”

He studied his mother for a long moment, finally beginning to understand why she seemed so paralyzed by inaction. She was a woman caught in an ideology.

“Peace was a dream mother. A dream that persisted for twenty years in our village. A dream that we were ripped from when the Fireglass put the village to the torch, threw us in chains.”

“Is it wrong to pursue a dream?” She asked in whispered desperation.

“Clinging to that dream is what brought us here,” Jackdaw said bitterly, “We saw the omens, and our dream of peace stopped us from preparing for war. Loam was murdered, and for a month our dream stopped us from acting. Even now, you hold on to that blasted dream while your clan is ground against the Fireglass shackles. There is a time and a place for dreams, mother, but it is not now, not here.”

She looked around, at the people of their clan, at the people she had led to the west those long years ago. Jackdaw did not know what she saw, but when she looked back to him, her eyes had resolved.

She pulled her hands from his grip, speaking in stubborn tones, “I’m sorry, my nestling, I cannot sacrifice these people, nor their dream, for some doomed revolt.” She pulled her hands from his grip and left him there, walking to an old man limping to return to his labor.

Jackdaw watched her for a long moment, as she led the limping man to a seat, healed his wound, wincing in pain as he thanked her. Swift approached him, leaning in to speak in soft tones.

“So, could she be convinced?” He asked.

Jackdaw waited a long moment before speaking. His mind racing past a thousand memories of his mother’s strength, a thousand fears for the future. No matter what she said, he was the head of the Heartwood clan, and the time for inaction had passed.

“No,” He finally said, “We’ll have to carry out the plan alone.”
