_To pass the time of the trek, we often taught each other language. We would teach him useful vocabulary and help him sound more fluent. He’d lost some of his Halfling accent, and secretly I lamented the loss of that charm. The boy, as we passed bits of nature, would call out a word in their tongue and smirk at our butchered pronunciations. One day, we came across the remains of a hare, gnawed at by a fox. He said a word that dripped sadness, and I needed no explanation for its meaning. Death._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

With a few rough strikes, Sycamore pounded the wooden stake into the ground. He tested the tension on the canvas and, satisfied that the tent was properly pitched, rose to his feet. He cast aside the rock he’d used as a makeshift hammer, turning to where Pike was finishing up with his corner.

“Things look good over here,” He called out. Pike grunted acknowledgement as he finished driving his own stake. As he rose he brushed off his hand, turning to Sycamore with a grin on his face.

“Thanks again for the help, Sprout.”

“Think nothing of it. I can hardly just wait while work gets done around me,” Sycamore said as they moved to where Lupin was knocking aside grass and lining stones for a makeshift fire pit.

“You’re an officer, right? Shouldn’t you be barking orders at someone?” Pike asked as he sprawled out on the ground. He threw his hands behind his head, laying back leisurely.

“Unfortunately, I have no one under my command to order around,” He paused, smirking at Pike, “Though if you’d like, I do see a recruit lounging about. Seems like he needs a scolding.”

“Ease off, I’ve finished setting up my tent. You’ve nothing to complain about.”

“You could always help me,” Lupin called as he struggled to cut through the sod on the ground with a rock. “I don’t know how you convinced me this would be easier than pitching a tent.”

“Pa always said that half of the effort of chores was finding the easiest one to do. And I knew from yesterday that there’s a shortage on spades,” Pike said, “Besides, without Sprout, here, I’d not be halfway done.”

“Happy to be of service,” Sycamore said as he sat down in a heap next to Pike. It was the second evening of their northward march and Sycamore had already grown sick of not having anything to do. His attendants refused any offer for help, so he found himself looking for work among his friends.

“Pike, quit lounging and help Lupin, or I’ll tan your hide,” Marrow barked as he and Granite joined them after pitching their own tent.

“Yes, sir,” Pike called, scrambling to his feet.

“And Sycamore,” Marrow said with a sideways glare, “Don’t distract my men.”

“Of course, sergeant,” Sycamore said with a nod. He stood up, moving to help Lupin and Pike.

_Don’t you outrank him?_ The Magus asked.

_Perhaps, on a technicality. That’s probably why he didn’t yell at me to help as well. But I hope you don’t expect me to try to order him around._ Sycamore could not even imagine how the grumpy old man would react if he tried to pull rank.

When they finally finished carving out the fire pit, Juniper and Perch had just returned with the firewood for the night. They dropped the armfuls of logs in a heap next to the pit, and Granite got to work starting the cook fire.

“So what’s it like in the front of the line?” Pike asked.

Sycamore shrugged, “I can tell you the road is much less torn up before the train marches through it.” As a member of the Speaker Corps, Sycamore’s place in the marching order was at the front with Lady Marigold and the other high ranking officers.

“Have you spoken much to the mercenaries?” Lupin asked.

“No,” Sycamore said, “They are... difficult to approach.” Behind the group of officers marched a band of mercenaries hired by Whitebrook, the Bedrock Comapany. There were three hundred of them, all in matching leather armor. It was an intimidating sight.

“I wonder what it’s like, to go from conflict to conflict, to be immersed in that life,” Lupin muttered. His tone was a mixture of haunted and awed. Sycamore shuddered. What little he’d seen of death and violence made him pale at the thought of pursuing it.

“If you’re curious, you ought to ask Marrow,” Granite asked as he arranged the wood for cooking, “After the Plains Wars, he signed on with a band not too different from these Bedrock folk.”

Pike turned to Marrow, who was staring into the fire and smoking his pipe. “What’s it like, sergeant? Do you ever miss home when you’re off fighting someone else’s war?”

Marrow gnawed on the end of his pipe for a moment before responding, “You miss home, yes. And ale, and beds, and the comfort of another. But that’s no different than any soldier’s life. The difference is, for a sellsword, it becomes a routine. The time on contract is a blur of dirt and boredom and foul food until a burst of action, bloody and sudden. The time between is a blur of ale and burning through the coin you earned until it’s time to move on to the next contract.” He paused to stretch his shoulder, rubbing at some old ache. “You become immersed in it, and before long it’s a lifestyle, and then suddenly it’s all memory.” He took a long pull from his pipe, blowing thick smoke into the evening air.

“Tell me, Sergeant,” Lupin said, his tone dark, “did you ever raze villages as a mercenary? Capture families, take prisoners?” His tone was challenging, an indictment.

Marrow looked up from the fire, staring at Lupin with heavy, old eyes. “When you sell your sword, you do not decide where to point it.”

Sycamore was staring at Marrow, searching for a reply when he heard a breathless yell behind him. He looked over his shoulder to see a man bent over, gasping for breath. Sycamore recognized him as one of the speakers’ attendants.

“Speaker Sycamore,” He called between gasps, “There you are.”

Sycamore rose to his feet, stepping over to the man at a quick pace.

“What’s wrong?” Sycamore asked. Judging by the attendant’s gasps for breath, whatever sent him searching was urgent.

“A meeting has been called,” the man said, “All the officers are to gather in the General’s tent immediately.”

With a frown, Sycamore nodded. He turned to say goodbye to his friends, but Pike waved him away. “Be off, Speaker Sycamore,” He said jovially, “We’ll save some food for you, if you decide to again grace us with your presence.” Sycamore nodded gratefully before moving to start the walk towards Lady Marigold’s tent. He paused, looking to the exhausted attendant.

“Thank you for finding me,” He said to the man, “Take a rest, I can make it alone.” The attendant, still catching his breath, gave a mute nod of appreciation. 

_What do you think this meeting’s about, that there was such a need for urgency._ Sycamore asked as he set off towards the center of the camp at a brisk pace.

_Do not forget the purpose of this army, Sycamore. This is no simple stroll on the countryside._ Sycamore swallowed, picking up his pace a bit as violent possibilities danced in his brain. He thought back to Marrow’s words. A burst of action, sudden and bloody.

------

Sycamore rubbed at an eye drowsily as he settled on the grass. He heard some of the other Speakers moan about the indignity of sleeping on the uncomfortable ground, but he was too tired to care. He bundled his cloak as a pillow and found a spot where no rocks or roots would dig into his back. Two hours, then it would be time to walk again. He needed to sleep as much as possible. When he woke, there would be no sleep until the battle had been fought. The thought sent a shiver through his limbs. Countless situations played out in his head as his eyes sagged closed. His body was exhausted, but his mind raced. 

_Do you believe her plan is sound?_ Sycamore asked.

_As I told you before, it’s aggressive, and there’s some risk. If things don’t go to plan or the scouts misjudged the timing, the morning may prove to be a messy affair._ The Magus sent.

_But if the scouts were right, and the plan works?_

_Your general is intelligent, and that’s a dangerous combination with aggression. If things play to course, you will be rewarded with an easy victory._ The Magus replied. It was reassuring to hear that. Sycamore just had to hope that Lady Marigold was as talented a strategist as she thought she was. The relief pushed back against worry just enough that his exhaustion overtook his anxiety and his eyes drifted close.

His dreaming, of fire and violence, was interrupted by a shake to his shoulder. His eyes shot open to see one of the Speakers’ attendants looking half-dead in the darkness.

“Apologies, Speaker Sycamore, but two hours have passed,” He said with a nod before moving on to the next person he had to wake. With a low groan, Sycamore forced some energy into his legs, rising to his feet. He half-heartedly brushed grass and dirt off his clothes, but was too tired to worry over such trivial things. In an effort to banish the sleepy fog from his mind, he pulled a wrist across his eyes. It didn’t work.

He heard various noises of protest and frustration as the other Speakers awoke around him. They were two hours out of Mistfield, and the sun had not yet started to rise. The plan was to come upon the village as morning came. Give the Fireglass as little time to react before they could attack.

As the army roused around him, Sycamore thought back to the meeting. It had not been long, orders shortly given, no time for protest or discussion.

“The scouts have spotted a sizable Fireglass force, about eight hundred strong, at Mistfield,” Lady Marigold had started. Before they could even react to that news, she’d launched into details, “Additionally, reinforcements of seven hundred soldiers will arrive tomorrow at midday. By our estimates, it’s about six hours of marching to the village, so even if we cut a faster pace than we have so far, the reinforcements will beat us there.” She paused for a breath, and a dozen voices called out questions. She raised a fist, quickly cutting them off. She wore a wicked smile. 

The call to move cut off Sycamore’s thoughts. With all the ease of a rusted hinge, the Whitebrook army started to move, making pace to arrive at Mistfield just before sunrise.

By the time the sky had turned to its morning hues, little remained of Sycamore’s tiredness. He was alert and awake, and only the thinnest fog clung to the back of his mind. Even that faded as thoughts of battle came to dominate. He knew, with the size and scale of the army, that he could not be around to heal his friends if anything wrong. He recalled Lupin on the ground of the forge, Perch with a slash in her neck. What if that happened here, today? He swallowed, trying to force those thoughts out of his mind.

_How do you stop yourself from panicking in worry before a battle?_

_If I ever find out, I will tell you,_ The Magus replied dryly, _Though I should say, it’s your first real battle, some panic is merited._

Sycamore frowned. There was a persistent itch on the back of his neck, a symptom of his anxiety, no doubt. He was a member of the Speaker Corps, but exactly what that meant, he had no idea. What would he use his speaking for, here? The question dominated his thoughts as he crested a hill and the skeleton of Mistfield came into view. It was still a good distance away, but Sycamore felt cold seeing the village, or what was left of it.

_There is an amount of irony, I believe. If they had not been so insistent on burning the village, their position would be much more defensible._ The Magus sent.

Little remained of Mistfield aside from blackened remains of buildings, torched, Sycamore imagined, in a similar way to the Heartwood village. Outside of Mistfield’s charred corpse was a field of tents, holding seven hundred Fireglass soldiers. Even from where he stood, Sycamore could see a bustle of activity among the tents. Their scouts were not idle, then, and the Whitebrook army had been spotted. They must also know, then that on the other side of the field, the noose had been pulled around their neck.

Lady Marigold had explained it in simple terms. “We’ll march through the night, on two hour intervals with two hours of rest between, to arrive at Mistfield at sunrise. We’ll crush the forces stationed there in the morning, and if they push on, we’ll crush their reinforcements in the afternoon,” She had the energy of a madwoman when she had spoken of her plan. There’d been a few protests. What if they simply fled at the sight of the Whitebrook army, only to regroup with their reinforcements and assault an exhausted army later in the day? How could they expect the army to fight a battle on such little sleep? 

“The Bedrock Company will march through the night with no rest. They’ll skirt the village far enough to avoid detection, and emerge to cut off their retreat when the sun rises. They’ll be the anvil to our hammer. And as for whether our soldiers can fight short of sleep, ask any who protest the orders if they’d rather fight a winning battle tired or a losing battle rested.”

Just as the sun peeked out over the distant Redrock mountains, the army began to organize. Sycamore moved with the other speakers to gather on a hilltop. The dozen men and women who made up the Speaker Corps looked haggard in the early morning light. Their clothes, normally carefully maintained, were a mess of grass stains and wrinkles. Sister Quartz looked the least affected of them all, though her face had an exhausted sag to it.

“Take a moment to gather your wits and wake up,” She started when they had all gathered, “I’ve received a briefing on the makeup of the enemy army from General Marigold, and I need your focus as we go over orders.” Sycamore took a deep breath in a futile attempt to dismiss his concern for his friends, his premonitions of violence. Calm was impossible, it seemed.

“Our primary missive is to run interference on the enemy Speakers. Conventional wisdom would estimate between five and nine speakers in this force, and our intelligence has provided no information that would disagree with the conventions.” It was standard, Sycamore had learned, for common soldiers to outnumber Speakers about a hundred to one. With twelve speakers, the Whitebrook army was below this standard, though he had no knowledge of whether the Bedrock Company included any speakers.

“With that understood, here are your orders. Speakers of the Flame, you’re to disperse evenly on the front lines. Stay just out of the vanguard, but close enough to respond should any of their own Speakers show themselves. If you find no resistance from other speakers, tear through their infantry.” Sycamore shuddered at the violent language. “Further back, half of the Speakers of the wind will be spread throughout the infantry, disrupting any Speaking we feel from enemies. Generally, you’re to follow the command structure of whatever squad you’re placed with. However, if you see, hear, or feel one of our speakers in trouble, I want you to move to assist.” She paused to wait for questions. When none came, she continued, “The remaining Speakers of the Wind will attempt to disrupt any volleys of arrows or other projectiles. Keep a fierce wind towards them, and sweep their shafts out of the sky with gusts. Understood?” There were grunts of assent, but Sycamore was too caught in his thoughts to respond. He had no concept of what running interference on another speaker would entail. He was about to raise his voice to ask when Sister Quartz forestalled his questions, “Speaker Sycamore, you joined us late and were not present for our training on Speaker against Speaker combat. You, along with Speakers Ivory and Ashroot will disrupt the projectiles.” She paused, looking at Sycamore with tired, heavy eyes, “Your outburst in the council, what part of your strength was that?”

Sycamore thought back to his anger at Councilman Lode. At the time, it had been as much as he could muster. He had grown immensely since then. “Half, maybe,” Sycamore said. There was a beat of hesitation, and then Sister Quartz nodded.

“Understood,” She said, “Speaker Sycamore is in command of the second squad, then. Take his lead.” Immediately, Ivory and Ashroot began to raise protests, but Sister Quartz raised a hand to cut them off, “Save your pride for when the battle is won. Sycamore is the strongest of you three. Take his lead.” She turned back to Sycamore, “Find General Marigold and get your positioning. Those to the frontlines, on me.” With a whip of her cloak, she spun, taking off at a brisk pace, leaving Sycamore standing with Speakers Ivory and Ashroot. He awkwardly looked at them, still mentally processing that he’d been given some command. He stared at them dumbly for a moment before the Magus jolted him back to reality.

_Do not just stand there like a mute,_ He sent, _Follow Sister Quartz’s orders, lest she regret trusting you._ Sycamore blinked a few times, trying to recall what she’d said before rushing off. That was it, he had to find Lady Marigold and learn where they were to position. He looked to Ashroot and Ivory for a moment. They stared at him petulantly, but Sister Quartz’s words held their tongue.

With an awkward nod, Sycamore said, “Let’s be off then.” He turned to search for Lady Marigold, and found it quickly. They’d traveled lightly in the night, leaving their supply train under light guard, but still some tables had been hauled to organize a command post. The General stood there, surrounded by frantic aids as she organized the army for the morning battle.

Sycamore joined the queue of people waiting to speak to her with the other speakers, and after a moment he approached her command table. There was a field map, roughly sketched of the village and its surrounding features, a dozen wooden markers spread across. He took a moment to glance it over before speaking up, “General Marigold, I was told to get orders from you.”

At the sound of his voice, she turned to him, a curious expression on her face. “Sycamore,” She said, her eyes flicking between Sycamore and the other speakers positioned behind him, “What’s this about, then?”

“I’ve been placed in command of the second squad of speakers,” Sycamore explained. He shuffled his feet, feeling slightly awkward. Her eyes widened slightly before she nodded, “Of course.” She looked back to her map, “How close do your speakers need to be to effectively use your abilities?”

Sycamore thought over the question for a moment before responding. “The closer the better, but we’ll hardly be able to focus if we’re in the thick of it.”

She nodded, scanning her map a moment before tapping a marked-off hill. She looked up, scanning the field in front of the village. She raised a hand, pointing off in front of her. “There, follow the foot until you’re at that hill. Line up behind the archers and hold. It should be far enough that you’re out of range of everything, as long as the wind keeps up.” The last part she said with a significant look towards Sycamore and his speakers. Sycamore nodded as he scanned the field, his eyes settling on the hill Marigold pointed at.

“Thank you, General,” Sycamore said, turning to leave when Lady Marigold placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Be careful out there. You should be safe on that hill, but keep your focus. Don’t get yourself killed. It would upset Juniper,” Lady Marigold said, a concerned look in her eyes. Sycamore nodded, biting back a comment that Juniper would be even more in the thick of things with Marrow’s squad. He knew she already understand that, and it wouldn’t do to distract her by bringing it up.

When Lady Marigold dismissed them, Sycamore and the others made their way towards the back of the amassing infantry. They’d left any mounts with the supply train, fearing a horse would break a leg in the darkness, and nearly all of the army was made up of foot soldiers.

Looking at the mass of soldiers, Sycamore strained his eyes to spot Marrow’s squad. But, in the bustle of movement as they organized themselves, it was impossible to spot his friends. He wondered what they spoke about, whether they felt as nervous as he. Pike was probably offering some bit of his pa’s wisdom as Lupin eagerly awaited his first chance at revenge for the embarrassment he suffered in their village. Juniper probably thought of her father with a grim expression on her face. He imagined Marrow’s expression didn’t change, and Granite and Perch were simply preparing for another life-and-death struggle.

He looked up to the village, where the Fireglass army had started to mass. Even from a distance, he could spot their armor, that red and black dyed leather. It reminded him of the man he had killed, a sling stone to the eye. He felt a wave of nausea sweep him as he thought about how many would die in the battle. He prayed none he knew would be among them.

Suddenly, he heard a loud horn, a chorus of shouts, and fourteen hundred pairs of boots hitting the ground. He blinked, mutely processing that the army had started moving in front of him. After he watched for a moment, he felt a jolt as Speaker Ashwood bumped his shoulder. She was giving him a significant, judging look, and he realized that they, too, had to move. With a prayer to the wind and a wish to see his mother, Sycamore started marching. He was a member of this army, and the battle had begun.
