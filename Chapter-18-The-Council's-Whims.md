_At some point, in the weeks since we started travelling together, the boy began to grow. He’d always been a fierce eater, as expected of his age, but soon enough I started to see exactly where that food was going. He grew at an astonishing rate. His shirt tightened on his frame, his trousers were suddenly too short. He was not one to complain, but I could see his discomfort. To help him along, I brought out my needle and loosened the seams on his shirts and trousers. He thanked me, but made a sideways comment that he would have liked this growth spurt to come years before._ 

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

Sycamore waited in the council’s sitting room, feeling uncomfortable in his clothing and his solitude. The clothes were a gift from Lady Opal and were far nicer than any set he’d ever owned. The matching set of trousers and shoulder tunic were in the same style as his old ceremonial garb. Those clothes, blue to match his mother’s own ritual outfit, were now burned to ash in his village. These clothes, green to match his eyes at Lady Opal’s recommendation, were soft and thin, but heavy with the burdens of responsibility.

Lady Marigold had approached them at breakfast with good news. The council were interested in meeting him that evening. The news had been met with joyous anticipation. It felt like an eternity since they’d set out from the Magus’s library, and finally their goal was in sight. The joy had faded to confusion as she explained more.

“The council wishes to meet Sycamore,” she’d said, “Not the Heartwood clan.”

There’d been protests and demands for explanation, but Lady Marigold had brushed them all off with simple insistence that the council wanted to meet Sycamore, specifically.

The door to the council’s chamber open, and a young attendant stuck her head out. “Master Sycamore,” she called, “the council awaits you.”

Upon hearing that he would face the council alone, Sycamore had been beset by anxiety. This was their clan’s chance, and he would have to carry on by himself. In his mind, Lupin and Mrs. Maple would do much of the talking, with his fervor and her unflappability. Even Pike, with his persistent friendliness, could have made the difference. Sycamore had none of those things. Yet he was to face them alone.

With a deep breath, he rose from his seat, moving with slow, even steps to the council chamber. It was part of their plan to maintain the illusion of calm confidence. With a smile and a wave of an arm, the attendant beckoned him forward as he stepped through the doorway.

They’d spent much of the day planning what he would say, trimming the story of their clan’s history with the Fireglass to bare, impactful moments. Lupin urged him to take an aggressive tone of expectation, demanding their help. Mrs. Maple urged caution to that approach and suggested phrase his appeals like a request for a favor. Pike simply smiled at him, and urged him to be himself.

The council’s chamber was a large room. The walls were decorated with fine art depicting old battles and significant moments in Whitebrook’s history. Several glass windows lit the room with natural light. The center was dominated by a large, semicircular table covered in reams of paper. Above the table hung an ornate chandelier, providing whatever light the windows could not. A handful of desks lined the walls, where attendants and note-takers sat watching him with a professional intensity.

On the curved end of the table, the council sat, staring with a mix of expressions. Lady Marigold was there on one end, smiling a half-smile. She looked to be the youngest member of the council, and also seemed the most pleased to see him. An older woman wearing a simple white dress sat at the center of the table and wore an expression schooled to practiced neutrality. Across from Lady Marigold, on the other end of the table, A man with a jagged scar across his chin watched him with familiarly outraged eyes. There were ten of them, all together, and most seemed unhappy to see him.

Taking a deep, centering breath, Sycamore stepped up to the podium. He gripped its edges, leaning a bit of his weight into the heavy stability of the furniture. He waited silently, for one of the council members to address him. Little warning had been given about what to expect, but Lady Opal had reminded him several times to wait for the council to start the meeting, lest he seem impatient and arrogant.

A long measure of silence passed as Sycamore willed his heart to calm itself. Anxiety would not serve him here.

“Sycamore, is it?” One of the councilors said in a soft voice. He was an unremarkable looking man, but sat central in the council next to the woman in white, perhaps at some suggestion of authority.

“Yes, sir,” Sycamore said, “Sycamore of the Heartw-”

“Are you a silkhair spy?” The scarred man said with gruff impatience.

Sycamore furrowed his brows, frowning in confusion. “Excuse me?”

“Were you sent by the scarecrows to spy on us, gather information on the state of Whitebrook?” The scarred man asked again.

“I’m afraid I don’t understand – I thought we would be talking about my clan.”

“Please, answer the question, Sycamore,” The central man said.

“Of whether I’m a Westfolk spy? No, I don’t even-”

“Then why have you come to Whitebrook?” The scarred man said, cutting him off again.

Sycamore swallowed, internally sighing. “I came with my clan, to ask for-”

“We did not ask about your supposed clan,” the central man said, “but of you. Why have you come to Whitebrook?”

Sycamore felt his stomach sink. If this was to be the tone of the meeting, there was little chance of a positive outcome. “I came with my – with some companions after our village was attacked by the Fireglass.”

“And what was your intent in Whitebrook?”

Sycamore shrugged, “To seek refuge, and support for our clan. They were taken, you see-”

“Your companions, are they Westfolk?” A new councilor said, his voice impossibly nasal.

Sycamore glared at the man who cut him off, but forced his frustration out of his tone. “No, I’m the only Westfolk among us.”

The man with the nasal voice nodded, scribbling a quick note on some paper with his pen.

There was a moment of silence as the council studied him. Sycamore waited for their next question with as much patience as he could muster, but finally spoke, “If we could, I’d like to speak about-”

“Your injuries, how did you receive them?” the central councilor said. Sycamore squeezed the podium, taking his annoyance out on the furniture. He’d been concerned of how the council would see his damaged state, but Mrs. Maple assured him that any decent person would take pity on him. As it stood, Sycamore was unconvinced of the decency of these folk.

“I was assaulted by another refugee to the city,” He said, offering no additional information. He knew they would just cut him off if he tried.

“And what did you do to provoke this assault?” The scarred man said, accusation dripping from his voice. 

Sycamore looked to the man, saw the heat in his gaze. He wondered what they saw in his eyes, if he looked as anxious and frustrated as he felt. “I offered to heal his wound.” They glared at each other for a moment before another councilor spoke.

“This business of healing, how much of the rumors are true?” The nasal voice said, “Did you truly heal hundreds of refugees from near death?”

“Of course not!” The scarred councilor burst, “No silkhair brat would-”

“Enough, Lode,” The woman in white said, “You agreed to let the boy speak.”

The scarred man, Councilor Lode, turned an angry eye on Sycamore but said no more.

“The rumors?” The woman in white asked again.

“I did not heal hundreds,” Sycamore said. He thought back to that time in the shantytown, “Perhaps eighty over three days.”

“And you can heal any injury, regardless of severity?” The nasal voice asked.

“It’s… difficult to explain,” Sycamore replied.

“Try.”

Sycamore couldn’t contain the sigh, but he tried nonetheless. “Most injuries I can heal well enough, but it depends largely on the severity of the injury as well as the strength of the person. There are some other things that play a part as well, like my own condition and whether they’ve been healed recently.” He thought back to Mastiff with a frown. “Additionally, I cannot heal anything that’s been severed from the body, missing fingers or toes. And any dead flesh or gangrenous wound must be cut away before the healing. Also,” He gestured to the wide bruise on his face, “I cannot heal any injury on myself.”

The watching attendants scribbled down the details as Sycamore spoke. Briefly, he considered whether there was some risk to speaking so much of his healing – he recalled vaguely his mother’s explanation of the old Heartwood clan demanding she heal them in battle – but he dismissed those concerns quickly. He needed to, somehow, win the council over. Answering their questions in half measures would not help achieve that goal.

“Interesting,” The central man said, “I’ve never heard of such an ability.”

“As far as I know, aside from me only my mother can heal,” Sycamore replied. Thinking of his mother, he wondered how she would react to this meeting. He had little doubt she’d browbeat these puffed-up councilors to submission. The edges of his mouth lifted in a slight smile. It was a nice thought.

“I see. And what was your motivation for healing the refugees?” 

“I expect you wouldn’t believe that I simply wished to help them, would you?” Sycamore asked, not understanding the thread of these questions.

“I would not,” The central man confirmed humorlessly.

Sycamore felt his temper rising. This was a waste of time. They’d gotten their hopes up for nothing. “I don’t understand the relevance of these questions,” He said spitefully, “I came to appeal for my clan, not to have my actions dissected for your leisure.”

“Sycamore of the Heartwood,” Lady Marigold said with emphasis, speaking for the first time in the meeting, “You’ve come to petition the council, not question our proceedings. Please, answer the questions as we ask them.” She still wore a half smile, and Sycamore struggled not to see it as mocking considering the circumstances.

He glared at the woman. Why had she not warned him that this would be a trial? Surely she would have known. But then, perhaps she had with that talk of her father, telling him not to worry about prattlers. He sighed bitterly, wishing she’d been clearer.

“Of course,” He said, doing his best to rein in his frustrating.

“Thank you,” She said with a small nod, “Now please, answer the question.”

“I healed them because I wished to help,” He started, “but also because we needed money to pay the fee to enter the city.”

“My understanding is that Councilor Marigold sponsored your entry into Whitebrook,” The central councilor said.

“Without discussing it with the council,” Lode added with a glare for Lady Marigold.

She eyed him back levelly, “I don’t recall the lockdown provision that mandates I ask you for permission whenever I use my authority, Councilor Lode.”

“Well those provisions with a mind that you had more sense than sponsoring a silkhair, Marigold.”

“Could you explain why you needed money to enter the city, considering your current sponsorship?” The central councilor asked Sycamore with a raised voice, cutting off the argument between the two others.

“Of course,” Sycamore said, looking between Lady Marigold and Lode. It gave him some confidence that there seemed to be cracks in the monolith. “We arrived at the city too short on coin to pay the fees. I noticed many needed healing, and so I went around fixing injuries for coin. In the end we were robbed of that coin, but I guess the rumors of my healing had spread. A member of our clan in Whitebrook recognized me from the rumors, and she happens to be the niece of Councilor Marigold.”

“A hefty coincidence,” The nasal voice said.

Sycamore nodded his agreement, “We thought the same, but it was a relief.”

“How much did you charge for your healing?” The central councilor asked.

Sycamore shrugged, “Whatever coin they were willing to pay. In truth, I understand little of money.”

“And if they had no coin to pay?”

“Then I healed them for free.”

“You can’t expect me to believe that a greedy-” Councilor Lode started.

“What did you get out of it, if not coin?” The woman in white asked. Her eyes were clear, searching without prejudice.

“I suppose I got the satisfaction and joy of healing another,” Sycamore said with a mirthless smile.

“You had no ulterior motive?”

Sycamore looked at the woman incredulously. “What possible ulterior motive could I have to healing someone?”

“We’d also like to know, which is why we are asking,” She said, “You’ve spent time with the refugees, you’ve seen how things are. Perhaps along with your healing you were sowing discontent among them.”

“Sowing discontent?” Sycamore cried, “I came to ask for help from Whitebrook. What would be the purpose of sowing discontent?” He slapped a hand on the podium, the sharp sound ringing through the room.

“Sycamore, please control your temper, it will help no one to raise your voice,” The central man said.

Sycamore laughed sardonically before speaking, “You ask me to control my temper but insist on asking questions to provoke me. I came with a simple plea for consideration for my clan, and you skirt the issue with a thousand pointless questions and accusaions.”

“Whether our questions are pointless is not your decision,” the councilor replied sharply, “But fine, let’s move on to your clan.”

Sycamore breathed a sigh, relieved to be past the pointless questions.

“Your clan, what are they called?”

“The Heartwood clan.”

“I understand the Heartwood is a clan far to the east,” Said a bald councilor in a slow, deep voice.

“Warmongers,” added Lode.

“We came from the east twenty years ago,” Sycamore said.

“And where did you settle?”

“To the south of the Songwood, just under a week’s travel from here.”

“That’s old Rockhide land,” Said the bald councilor. He turned to the nasal voice, “Does this branch of the heartwood even pay taxes to us?”

There was a shuffle of papers for a moment before the nasal voice spoke, “There’s no record of it. We’ve no obligations to them.”

“So, Sycamore,” Said the central councilor, “can you explain what you’d like from us?”

Eagerly, Sycamore launched into his prepared petition, speaking quickly so as to finish before being cut off, “We were attacked by the Fireglass, and nearly all of my clan was taken prisoner. We came to Whitebrook to ask for help in some way. It would be too much, I know, to ask you to send an army at our request. But, seeing how things are here, I know you must have some plan to address the Fireglass, and we just ask that those plans include helping to free our clan.” No matter what Lupin wanted, it would be folly to demand anything from these people after what Sycamore had seen.

There was a pause as the Councilors muttered to each other. Sycamore watched them, studying their expressions. Councilor Lode glared at him wickedly, the vitriol of the expression doubled by his scar. Lady Marigold still wore that enigmatic smile, but it seemed to have widened slightly. The others wore a range of expressions, but none gave him hope. The woman in white, central on the table, stared at him with a searching expression. He met her gaze for a moment, but the intensity of her stare forced him to break eye contact.

A moment passed as the council discussed his request. Sycamore stood anxiously waiting, scratching a groove into the podium with a fingernail.

Finally, the central man spoke, “If that’s your request, then we can easily put it to a vote.” He glanced around him at the other councilors.

“Those in support of providing assistance for the Heartwood clan?”

Sycamores felt the air flee his lungs when he saw no hands rise. His eyes darted to Lady Marigold. She watched him with that same smile, but her hand stayed lowered.

“Those opposed?”

Sycamore watched for an eternal instant as nine hands rose. He felt a stab of betrayal as Lady Marigold’s hand rose. In the part of his mind that wasn’t panicking, he mutely noted that the woman in white had not raised her hand.

“With none in support and nine opposed, the issue is resolved. We will not provide assistance to the Heartwood clan.”

There was a frantic scribble of notes as the attendants recorded Sycamore’s failure on their papers.

“You can’t do this!” Sycamore called out.

“The issue is resolved, Sycamore,” Said the central man, “I’m sorry, but we have decided.” His tone was perfectly neutral, lacking any apology.

“You condemn my clan, my mother to chains!”

“You may see it that way, but we have no responsibility to your clan,” The nasal voice said, “They pay no taxes to us, contribute nothing to the Whitebrook clan.”

“Their blood will be on your hands! Six hundred lives, because you denied me here!” He felt his hands shaking as he squeezed the podium in a desperate grip.

“That’s enough, brat,” Lode called out, “Do not blame your clan’s weakness-”

“Your mother,” The woman in white said in a calm voice that cut through the room, “What is her name?”

The central councilor turned to the woman in white, “Sister Quartz?” She ignored him.

Sycamore blinked. She was a priestess, then. “Poppy,” He said.

“And is she a Priestess of the Wind?” 

“Yes,” Sycamore confirmed. He felt the smallest bit of hope at the bottom of his stomach. He had forgotten that his mother had a reputation. Perhaps, if they knew of her, they would change their decision.

“Your lies begin to catch up with you, scarecrow,” Lode said with a sneer, “Everyone knows priestesses swear off having children.”

Sycamore glared at the bigoted councilor, “My mother found me as an infant and raised me. It’s no lie.”

“I thought the description of your healing sounded familiar,” Sister Quartz said. 

The central councilor studied her a moment before he turned his gaze to Sycamore, eyes widening. “You don’t mean-”

“The storm priestess,” Sister Quartz confirmed. Around her, the council reacted in open surprise. Apparently Sycamore’s mother was more notable than he knew.

Lode barked a rough laugh. “Surely you jest, Sister,” He said, “The storm priestess died decades ago.”

“I thought so as well,” Sister Quartz said, “But if what Sycamore says is true…”

“You don’t actually believe this silkhair, do you?” Lode said, “Why would the storm priestess take in a Westfolk brat?”

“My mother cast off that name when she came west,” Sycamore said, his anger rising to cover his disappointment and shame, “And I will not have you question my relationship with my mother.”

“Your ‘mother’ was a powerful warrior and a famed tactician, why would she leave that to settle in empty land and raise a scarecrow?”

“She chose a life of peace. And she taught me everything I know. That I stand here today is because of her. My ability to heal, my ability to Speak with the Wind, I owe everything to her,” Sycamore said fiercely.

“You are a Speaker?” Sister Quartz asked suddenly, “And your mother taught you?”

“She taught my brother, and he taught me,” Sycamore said, still glaring at Lode.

“So you have a brother now? How do you explain that one?” Lode said with a laugh.

“He’s an orphan of a Fireglass attack. My mother took him in as well.”

“Will the nonsense ever cease? Even if, as you say, your mother is the storm priestess, and even if she was seized by cowardice and fled west, you expect us to believe that she taught you our sacred arts? I have had enough of your nonsense, brat.”

Sycamore, seized by rage, took a deep breath. His eyes darted around the room. A window was open, a page on the desk fluttered in the breeze. There was wind here, even inside. He felt the thrum of power, reached out and let it flow through him. He used his anger to fuel the connection, not forcing the wind but convincing it to bend to his will.

With a wave of his hand, a squall burst through the window, slamming it on its hinge into a wall and shattering a pane of glass. Dozens of pages were swept into the air with the wind, and the room was filled with a chaotic mass of paper and the roar of a storm. He heard an attendant scream in shock as he shoved the wind towards Lode, pressing him with all the power he could. The sneer fell from the man’s face, replaced by an ugly expression of fear. Held against his chair, he raised an arm to block his eyes against the buffeting storm of wind. Sycamore leaned forward, using all his strength from his endless, desperate practice, taking out his anger at the man, at the council, at his failure to gain their support.

Suddenly, he felt a jolt as a spike of power slammed into his connection with the wind, snapping it like dried kindling. Silence returned to the room as the hundreds of papers fluttered slowly to the ground.

“If you try to use your Speaking again, I will remove you from this chamber in chains,” Sister Quartz said. She must have been responsible for the severing of his power, somehow disrupting his ability with her own.

Sycamore glared at her. “He doubted my abilities, so I provided a demonstration,” Sycamore said. He was still frustrated, angry at the circumstances, but felt much calmer after his outburst.

Sycamore and Sister Quartz glared at each other as the other councilors looked at him with shocked expressions. Lady Marigold wore a wide grin, and Lode was sputtering out bits of sand and dirt kicked up by the wind.

Suddenly, Lady Marigold began laughing. Sycamore turned his glare to her, unsure of what to think of the woman. He had liked her before this meeting, but she’d offered no help, no support, and even had voted against aiding their clan. And now, she laughed.

“I believe I’ve seen enough to decide,” She said, wiping a tear out of one eye. 

“Sycamore,” She said, “Do you still wish for aid for your clan?”

He clenched his jaw. Was she mocking him? 

“Yes,” He finally said.

She nodded, clapping her hands in front of her. “Wonderful, I’ve decided to help you, after all. We cannot provide military aid, but our scouts have reported a prison camp full of miners that we believe to be your Heartwood clan. I’ll give you the location. What you do from there will be your responsibility, but I expect you can handle yourself.”

Sycamore stared at her with wide eyes, unsure of whether to believe her. He was not the only one surprised.

“Marigold, you cannot do that!” Lode snarled, “The brat should be thrown in the dungeon for what he’s done here, not given military intelligence!”

She waved a hand dismissively, “Enough, Lode, you pestered the boy so much I would have been surprised if he had done nothing. I’m in command of this operation, and what we do with our information is my discretion.” She smirked at Sycamore, “Don’t mind him, he simply hates the Westfolk because he believes the scar they gave him scares off women. Gives him something to blame besides his awful personality.”

Lode made an outraged noise, but before he could speak, she continued, waving a hand in dismissal at Sycamore, “Now get out of here. I’ll handle the rest.”

Sycamore, unsure of whether to regard the meeting as a success or failure, turned and left the Council room just as Lode began an enraged tirade at Marigold.
