_We stood on the banks of a river, the border between the kingdoms and Halfling lands. There’d been a bridge that crossed it once, but it had been long since torn down. When my companion and I initially came west, we’d taken the ferry, and soon enough we found the ferryman’s bell. The boy was fidgeting nervously, which amused me greatly. I asked him if he was prepared, to travel the kingdoms, walk the land of his people for the first time. With a smile, he said that he was ready for anything._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

They held the funeral for the fallen in the midmorning. Those that still had energy gathered wood for a pyre. Those that did not sat in silent mourning.

Twenty-two had died in their escape, given their lives to protect the rest. Half that had fallen in the initial defense, and the rest on their retreat as Fireglass forces harried them before finally giving up their pursuit. It was an improbably low number, considering the forces against them and the clan’s exhaustion. Even in his most optimistic of estimates, Sycamore had expected twice that number to fall. Somehow, it still felt like a failure.

He sat with his brother in the quiet companionship of shared despair. There was too much to say, to discuss about their future, but neither had the desire or energy to say anything at all. Their mother was dead, an infinite shadow over their hearts. Her body was with the others, lined in a long row on a stack of logs as tired hands continued to pile wood around them. Granite and Perch led the effort, eagerness to begin the journey back to Whitebrook driving them. Sycamore hated them for it, hated them for not understanding the loss he felt.

When enough wood had been gathered, the Heartwood clan massed around the pyre. For a funeral, his mother would say a prayer in her ceremonial garb, one of the few roles she still kept from her days as a priestess. This time, Sycamore supported Jackdaw as he moved to the front of the crowd. They turned to face their clan.

“I don’t properly have the words to express the emotions that spin in my head,” Jackdaw started hesitantly. His voice was soft and weak, but carried easily through the dry morning air.

“I have never been prouder of my brother, who came, with Pike, Lupin, Juniper, and our new friends Granite and Perch, to free us from the suffocating chains of the Fireglass.” A few cheers sounded at that, but Sycamore felt nothing but sadness from them. Jackdaw continued, “I’m relieved, too, that this long nightmare, from Loam’s murder to this morning, is finally over.” Juniper stood at the front of the crowd, watching Sycamore and Jackdaw with sad, pitying eyes. He remembered her screams from the night of her father’s death. She, at least, understood their pain.

“More than anything, though, I feel sorrowful and grateful. Grateful that these twenty two brave souls would pay their last, greatest contribution to our clan, would give their lives to pay for our liberation. And sorrowful, of course, that on our return there will be twenty two fewer men and women to share our freedom with, to toil and labor with to rebuild, to feast with when things finally have returned to normal.” His voice was hoarse now, shaking as he held back tears.

“In some way, it is my fault that we stand here. Many felt the omens, saw the signs with Loam’s death, heard the screams on the wind, but still we did nothing. I am the head of the clan, and I did nothing to protect us. My mother and twenty one others are dead from my inaction. I’m so – so sorry,” His voice broke, and Sycamore felt him shaking on his shoulder.

A moment more and Jackdaw took a breath, steadying himself, “But no more. Our obsession with peace has led us here, our distance and isolation from others. We cannot let it continue, cannot allow these men and women to have died in vain. We owe them more than we can possibly give but at least we must lead the clan to security.” Sycamore felt the resolve in his brother’s words. There would be some controversy about Jackdaw’s statements, some who claimed he spat on his mother’s legacy. But Sycamore had heard it himself, his mother’s final understanding that her dream of permanent peace was impossible. Some of the older folk might protest, but Jackdaw would not back down, he knew.

“Finally, I can say for my mother, and all others who fell here: you will be missed, dearly, every moment for the rest of our lives. When we feel the wind in our hair, the sun on our skin, the grass on our feet, all the joys of life, we will think of you. Thank you, and be peaceful in your rest.” He turned to grab a burning stick from a small fire that had been prepared, pulling away from Sycamore’s support. With an awkward hobble, he took a few steps forward and thrust the stick into the pyre, releasing it when he saw that the kindling had caught fire. A few steps back, and he nearly collapsed into Sycamore. He felt himself shaking under the weight of his brother, under his own exhaustion and sorrow.

With a quiet voice, shaky and off-pitch, Jackdaw began to sing a hymn of rebirth. Sycamore joined the song through his tears, casting his voice as loudly as he could, hoping his mother could hear him. Soon, others began to sing, and the song carried into the treetops, hundreds of voices joined to say farewell to the fallen. Normally, they soaked the wood with oil, but they had none now, so it was long minutes before the fire started to burn in earnest. They sang all the while, beginning the song again each time they reached the end. It was long minutes more before the fire reached his mother, but Sycamore could not see through the tears in his eyes, could not hear the sounds of the fire over his own voice, hoarse and exhausted.

At some point, he could sing no more, his voice breaking to a wail as the fire continued to burn, as his clan continued to sing. His knees gave out, and he crumbled to the ground with Jackdaw. They clung to each other as the fire snapped and roared in front of them, bringing their mother to her final rest.

A long while later, the fire burned low. His voice was too hoarse to wail, his heart too drained to cry. The song slowly died with the fire, each lost in their own thoughts. When silence finally returned, Sycamore stood, helping Jackdaw to his feet, and they turned to the clan.

“Now,” Jackdaw called, voice rough from the song and tears, “We move to Whitebrook to rest and recover before we rebuild.”

Movement started slowly, the reluctance of a tired boulder beginning its tumble down the hill. Soon enough, though, the Heartwood had a surge of energy, a desire to be gone from this place and the sorrow here. Perch came to take Jackdaw from him, relieve him of that burden in their travels.

Before Sycamore handed his brother off, he spoke to him. It pained him to talk, his throat sore from his hysterics, but he had a message to convey.

“I befriended a woman in Whitebrook,” He said, “Juniper’s Aunt Marigold. She made an offer to our clan.”

-----

Sycamore realized, belatedly, that he had grown quite a bit in the months since the attack on the village, since his mother’s death. He stood next to Pike, Trout, and Lupin in the central square of Whitebrook. He was not yet so tall as them, but he was no longer embarrassed by his height sanding with them. 

There was a raised podium at the front of the square, and Whitebrook’s council stood to address them. Zephyr, the clan head, called in a loud, regal voice, “We are here to recognize the coming of age of those from the Whitebrook clan and its allies. This year, of all years, it feels unnecessary when I look down at the men and women in front of me. Already many of you bear the scars of battle, memories of war.” Pike shot out an elbow to nudge him, pointing at his eye patch with a grin when Sycamore turned to look. His eye had been lost in the battle at the prison camp, and even when he had recovered, Sycamore could not bring it back. He smirked back to his friend, drawing a line across his torso where his burns had scarred. 

The speech continued from the podium, “Still, this day can serve as a reminder of growth, of the children you once were, the men and women you’ve become. Do not forget that change as you step forward as adults in your clans. Whitebrook would be nothing with the men and women who inhabit it, and I know that to be true of all clans.” Lady Marigold stood next to Zephyr, wearing her ever-present, enigmatic half smile. Her campaign had been wildly successful, a series of quick victories before a prolonged battle with the head of the Fireglass clan that resulted in peace negotiations and a new scar to add to the fierceness of her face. They called her The Thorny Rose of Whitebrook, an appropriate moniker, in Sycamore’s opinion.

“Of course, it would not do to forget those who have brought you so far, let you become who you are today. I hope you take a moment to thank your parents, thank your elders, thank anyone who has given you wisdom.” Sycamore’s smile faded, but only for a moment. Time dulled all hurts, and, though he knew he would never fully move past it, he’d come to accept his mother’s death in the months since they’d returned to Whitebrook.

_Thank you, Magus._ 

_Do not thank me yet, our time together has yet to truly begin._ Sycamore smirked as he thought of the coming journey, excitement bubbling in his chest.

“With that said, I have little else to add besides congratulations. Enjoy the festivities and prosper in adulthood.” There was applause from the boys and girls, now men and women, who filled the square, and they slowly filtered away to spend their day in the city. This was just a component of the harvest festival, part of a greater autumnal celebration.

He gathered in a group with his friends as people moved around them. Occasionally he saw surprised looks as people recognized he was not of the Hillfolk, but he paid them no mind. He was among his friends here, no words they could say would rob him of that.

“What do you say? Shall we enjoy the day?” Trout said, wrapping an arm around his brother’s shoulder. It was much easier to tell the two apart with Pike’s missing eye, and they lamented the new inability to trade chores when they wanted.

“A moment,” Sycamore said, “I’d like to speak to Lady Marigold.”

“I’ll join you,” Lupin said. Sycamore gave him a questioning look, and his friend shrugged, grabbing at the sword he still carried sheathed at his waist, “I want to ask her about training with this thing, now that I can.” Sycamore nodded. After his soul was drained in the fight, Lupin had been extremely weak, more than Sycamore first knew. He was slow to recover, walking with a crutch for more than a month after their return. Finally, though, he seemed hale and healthy.

“We’ll get some food and drink then, meet us when you’re finished,” Pike said with a wave before he and Trout turned to leave.

“I pray you’re not drunk by the time we find you,” Sycamore called after them, shaking his head with a smile. With a gesture, he and Lupin approached the Podium at the front, where the council were standing with their attendants.

He avoided eye contact with Lode, but gave a respectful nod to Sister Quartz. He’d visited her once or twice, questioning specifics about speaking too advanced for Jackdaw to answer. She’d proven a generous and able teacher.

“Boys, it’s good to see you,” Lady Marigold said, brushing off her attendant and smiling at their approach. She paused, tilting her head to think, “Or men, now, I suppose. Congratulations.”

Sycamore smiled as he replied, “Thank you. Though I can’t say I feel any different than I did yesterday.”

“Yes, I believe you’ve suffered the burdens of adulthood for quite a while, now,” She said, “To what do I owe the pleasure of your company? Is Jackdaw looking for me?” His brother had spent many hours speaking with Lady Marigold to negotiate the specifics of their clans relationship to Whitebrook, forming something between a business relationship and a friendship.

Sycamore shook his head, “No, I came on my own accord. I want to-”

“To say goodbye?” She guessed. 

Sycamore blinked in surprise. “Yes, but how did you know I’d be leaving?”

“Juniper told me. She’s around, by the way, with my wife. I’m sure they’d both be quite happy to wish you farewell.”

“I’ll be sure to, before we head back to the village.”

“Good. You leave tomorrow, then?” Her voice had a forlorn note to it, but she smiled nonetheless.

Sycamore nodded, “At sunrise, it’s a long way west, you know.”

“And you’re still planning on going alone?” She asked. Again, Sycamore nodded. Lady Marigold sighed, “It’s a shame. I’d have liked to see the type of man you’d grow into: a healer, a speaker, and the lone Westfolk in a realm of Hillfolk.”

“I’ll be back eventually,” Sycamore said, but his stomach turned. He had long since accepted it, but the thought of being away from his village was still unsettling.

“I know, but by then, who knows what will have changed?” She paused with a frown, her voice her voice becoming suddenly serious, “Fine. Promise me something then.”

Sycamore felt his brows furrowing at the sudden change of tone. “Of course,” He said hesitantly.

“Promise you won’t change your heart from that boy who stood defiantly in the council chambers on behalf of his clan, from the boy who wept as his enemy died in his arms, from the boy who fought so hard to free his friends and family from captivity.”

Sycamore swallowed, but found himself oddly happy at her words. “I promise.”

She clapped her hands, and levity returned to her face. “Right then. Farewell Sycamore, best of luck on your travels.” She turned to Lupin, “What about you? Sycamore will travel alone, so you must have a different reason for finding me.”

“I’d like to ask you to recommend me someone to train me in the sword,” Lupin said awkwardly. Lady Marigold had done so much for their clan that Sycamore understood the difficulty in asking her for a favor. “Not for free, of course – just someone to help me become stronger.”

As Lupin spoke, the smile widened on Lady Marigold’s face. When he finished, she let out a peal of laughter. “I was wondering how I would spend my afternoon!” She said, throwing an arm around Lupin’s shoulders, “I, of course, will be more than happy to train you. Let’s begin now.” She started to drag Lupin along, silencing his protests with assurances that she would not go too hard on him, at first. Sycamore laughed, silently wishing his friend luck as he turned to leave and search for where Pike and Trout had wandered off.

-----

They arrived at the new village just after sundown. Sycamore had finally manage to free himself from Lady Opal’s farewell when Lupin returned from his training, bruised and grumpy. Juniper’s aunt had taken an odd change of perspective on their return from the prison camp, especially when she learned they would be constructing their new village so close to Whitebrook. She seemed to give Sycamore full credit for protecting her niece, and Sycamore was more than weary of her endless thanks. When Lupin had come to them, refusing healing and stating that he’d get his revenge the next time he came for training, Sycamore had used it as an excuse to beg off. Juniper had stayed mostly silent at her aunts rambling, wishing him a quiet, final farewell when he left the city with the others.

Pike and Trout, drunk and giddy, split off at the outskirts, off to spend the evening in their newly finished house. Sycamore had little doubt that their mother would scold them something fierce, but he knew they would manage.

When they passed the forge, Lupin left to go help his father, who was still working despite the darkness, tinkering with the metal hand he was forging to replace the one he’d lost in the battle. It was a work in progress, but Rhubarb loved the forge too much to surrender to something as small lost hand.

Sycamore arrived at the house he and Jackdaw shared just as Perch was leaving. She shared a kiss with his brother, waving goodnight to Sycamore fondly as she set out for the north, making the same trek he had just made with the others. Somehow, without Sycamore noticing, Jackdaw and Perch had developed a romance, shocking him when they announced their engagement a few weeks earlier. They would be wed in the spring, after Jackdaw went to her village to meet her family. After the wedding, she would join the Heartwood clan. Sycamore was sad he would miss it.

“How was the festival?” Jackdaw asked as he watched his fiancée leave with a smile. Sycamore smirked at his brother. He did not understand romance, but he could recognize love when he saw it.

“Fun. I ran into Granite and Marrow. Granite was about to set out with some merchant’s caravan as a guard, but Marrow has finally decided he’s too old for that,” Sycamore said. He smiled, “As for us, Pike and Trout drank too much, and Lupin got roped into a sparring session with Lady Marigold.”

“About what I expected, then,” Jackdaw said as he turned to his brother. “Did you drink?”

“No, I did not want to be hungover when I started my trip tomorrow.”

Jackdaw suddenly laughed, “That would be a sight, wouldn’t it, out on your long awaited journey, a headache and a queasy stomach plaguing you.”

Sycamore smiled, not so much at the comment, but his brother’s good humor. “I’m going to visit Mother before I sleep, if you’d like to join,” He said.

Jackdaw nodded, and the pair walked slowly to the center of the village.

“How do you think she would have reacted to me deciding to leave just as things are getting settled?” Sycamore asked as they walked.

“I believe she would have accepted it. After all, she knew better than most that sometimes, you must leave to find your place.” He’d told them he was leaving to pursue his heritage, to learn more about the Westfolk. It was not the full truth, but he’d decided to keep his deal with the Magus a secret. In truth, he wanted nothing more than to spend time with his family and friends. Still, he did not feel it was a lie, as he did feel curious about the Westfolk, about himself. 

“I’ll be back, Jackdaw. The Heartwood clan will always be my home.”

“I know,” Jackdaw said softly. They paused in their walking in front of a tall stone spire, nearly twice Sycamore’s height. Forty-nine names were carefully carved out of the stone. Loam, the first murdered; Seventeen in the assault on the village; three dead in their sleep in the prison camp; twenty-two in their escape; and six more from exhaustion on their trek back to Whitebrook. Those that died from the nightmare of the Fireglass.

One of those names was his mother’s. He spotted it, about halfway down the list, Poppy, written in precise script. At the bottom, there was a simple inscription: “This memorial is for those forty-nine who died so the rest could live. May they rest in peace.”

“I’m leaving tomorrow, Mother. I’m going west,” Sycamore said, “Watch over me, please. I’ll return with stories.”

_I know I offered this before, but you could stay until the spring. I would not fault you for it._

_No. The longer I wait, the more I watch the village go up around me, and the harder it will be to leave. I’ll leave tomorrow to fulfill our contract, Magus. And then I can return and see how things have changed on my return._

_To my surprise, I find myself also looking forward to seeing that._

The brothers stood a moment longer by the memorial in silence before Sycamore spoke, “Come on, It was a long day, and I have an early morning tomorrow. Sleep calls to me.” A final, lingering look at the memorial, and they returned to their house.

-----

Sycamore tried his very best not to be sullen as he finished preparing for his departure. He’d spent his time since waking up arguing with the Magus about the details of their trip. Sycamore was eager to journey it the lands of the Westfolk, but the Magus insisted he was not ready. He did not know the language, nor the culture, and to arrive as he was would only bring up all sorts of questions Sycamore did not want to answer. In the end, Sycamore relented, but it irked him that he would have to spend the next months in the Magus’s sanctum, studying over his books. He’d worked himself into an excitement to see new lands, and this was nothing but a betrayal of those expectations.

He stuffed the last of this possessions into his pack. The leather sack contained little more a change of clothes and a set of dining trinkets. Of course, his sling was bound at his waist and his knife was on his belt, but the Magus insisted he had everything else he’d need in his library.

He left the house with little ceremony. Jackdaw was gone when he woke, probably off to do some errand as head of the village. Sycamore was grateful, in a way. He was not fond of goodbyes, and one to his brother would be difficult with how close they’d grown.

The sun had yet to rise, and the village was quiet. Thanks to laborers sent by Whitebrook, most of the buildings had been finished, though Rhubarb’s forge still lacked a roof. There were still signs of their quick construction, but already the stone and wood were starting to show signs of use. It was quickly becoming their home, and he would miss it dearly, miss the people who lived here.

As Sycamore drew near to the outskirts of the village, he frowned in confusion. A small group was gathered at the edge. His eyes widened, and suddenly he was smiling.

_Your brother is a kind soul._

A handful of folk were there, waiting to see him off. Jackdaw was the first to notice him, waving a hand and laughing brightly. Lupin stood next to him. Pike and Trout were there too, though they looked far past miserable – hungover, no doubt. Mrs. Maple smiled at him, just showing signs of her pregnancy, and Gramps stood next to her, pipe slotted between his teeth. Mrs. Maple wrapped him in a hug when he stepped near.

“You did not think you could leave without saying goodbye, did you?” She said when the hug ended.

“I’d hoped to avoid causing a scene, actually,” Sycamore said, grinning.

“Sprout, I’ve known you for a long time, and I can confidently say that you couldn’t avoid causing a scene if you tried,” Trout said, forcing a smile despite his obvious nausea. He and his brother still reeked of wine.

“You should have seen him in the army, the way he healed everyone. You’d think he was trying to outdo the rest of us,” Pike said, “Speaking of which, have you yet learned how to cure a hangover?” He rubbed at his stomach, looking green in the face.

Sycamore laughed, shaking his head, “That’s something you’ll have to push past yourself, I’m afraid.” He stepped up, wrapping the twins in a hug. They were his oldest friends, his best friends. He slapped their backs, but stepped away quickly when he heard the sound of Pike starting to retch.

“Never again,” Pike said after wiping the vomit from his mouth, “No more wine for me.”

“Everyone says that,” Gramps said with gruff humor, “but we keep going back. You’ll learn to limit yourself eventually.” The old man turned to Sycamore, “Stay safe out there, son. Remember you always have a home to return to.” Sycamore nodded with a smile.

Lupin stepped forward, slapping Sycamore heartily on the back with a wicked grin. “I’m going to miss you, runt,” He nodded, “I needed to call you that once more. From what I hear of the Westfolk, by the time you return to us, you’ll be taller than even the twins.”

“Look forward to me repaying years of taunts, then,” Sycamore said, “Goodbye Lupin, good luck with your training.”

He turned to his brother.

“I know you detest goodbyes, but suffer through this one for me,” Jackdaw said. He stepped forward and hugged Sycamore. “Farewell, my brother. You always had more of mother’s sense, so I know you’ll be fine.”

Finally he pushed away from the hug, turning to those who had come to see him off, to his friends. “Farewell, everyone. Look forward to my return, whenever that may be.”

A few final hugs and he was off, leaving his village behind to the unknown west. A smile was on his lips, all sullenness from the morning gone. Tears were in his eyes, but he blinked them away. He was sad to go, but happier still that he had a home to return to.
