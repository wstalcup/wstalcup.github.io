_At first glance, the boy’s youthful features and innocent face spoke of naiveté. The longer I traveled with him, the more I realized that was a farce. He was covered with scars, from the knick on his nose to the line down the side of his face. His hands, too, were rough with callused skin, and I never saw his eyes flinch as he butchered his game. His face spoke of youth, but his scars spoke of experience._ 

An Excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

“Your work, Sprout?” Pike asked as Sycamore tugged the baldric off the corpse. With a yank, it came free of the dead man, still staring a blank, one-eyed stare skyward next to the pool of vomit where Sycamore had left him. Sycamore grunted assent, pulling the sword-belt over his shoulder and sheathing the blade he had taken from the man earlier. It was too large for him, and the sword hung low on his leg, but it was still better than lugging the thing around in hand.

“Nice aim,” Lupin commented dully. He still looked pale and seemed to suffer from occasional bouts of dizziness, but the small amount of rest they’d taken had brought enough recovery that he was mostly steady on his feet.

“You’ll have to tell us about it,” Pike said, trading his shepherd’s crook for the dead man’s spear.

“Later,” Sycamore said, “For now, we move.” He still wasn’t sure how to feel about the life he had taken. On the one hand, the man had torched his house and attacked his clan, and if he hadn’t smashed his skull with a stone, Sycamore would likely be the one staring that empty, skyward stare. On the other hand, his one-eyed face would surely haunt Sycamore’s dreams for a long time.

The reunion with Pike had been laughter filled, but the cheer quickly faded to uncomfortable silence as the reality of the situation set in.

“When the smoke started, Ma and Pa set off to the village to check the situation,” He had told them, “Trout and I were to mind the flock. A few moments after they set out, we were both dozing in the shade.” His face had lacked his characteristic joy, replaced by sadness, resignation.

“We heard them coming a few hours later. At first, we’d thought Ma and Pa had returned, but then we heard the voices. We’d set off to hide, but they followed us, found us quickly.” There was a heavy pause. “Trout led them off, told me it was his turn for glory to make up for mine at the hunt last month. Before I had a chance to protest, he sprinted off, jeering at them and taunting them to follow. I waited, hidden in cowardly silence, for hours before I thought it safe enough to come check the village.”

“Brave stuff, that brother of yours,” Lupin had said. Sycamore had remained silent, jaw clenched. After relying so many times on the twins to protect him from troublesome situations, he knew, partially, how Pike must have felt watching his brother save his skin.

Quickly, they had realized that waiting around in the village was not a long-term plan. Sycamore, tiring of carrying the sword around, led them back to retrieve its scabbard.

“Where are we headed?” Pike asked.

“To follow the Fireglass raiders, right, runt?” Lupin said, “I owe one of them a poke in the gut.” He clenched a hand on his sword.

“Not yet,” Sycamore said. He wasn’t sure, long term, which course they should take, but for now there were a few things left to check. “We should make a sweep of the distant farms, gather anyone left before we decide on what to do.”

“If we wait so long, we’ll never catch up to them!” Lupin protested. He seemed taken by the idea of revenge.

“As you are, I doubt we could catch them anyway,” Sycamore said, “Besides, even a small cut would risk you bleeding out. We need to play it safe, at least until you’ve recovered.”

Lupin took a step forward, leaning to tower over Sycamore. “I thank you for healing me, runt, but don’t think that gives you leeway to tell me when I can and cannot fight.” He laid a hand heavily on Sycamore’s shoulder. His grip was weak, shaky.

Pike stepped forward and batted the hand away. “Lay off it, Lupin. Sycamore saved your life, and he has more knowledge on healing than anyone aside his mother. If he says you’re not fit for fighting, trust him.” Lupin scowled at Pike but offered no complaint.

“That said, Sprout, are you sure there’s a point to checking the farms? They came through our pasture a few hours back, by now they must have been through most of them.”

“We’ll start with the furthest, make our way in. If we cut a brisk pace, we can hopefully make it through a few and warn people off before their raiders come through. We’ve got the advantage of knowing exactly where the farms are placed. We’ll cut corners, take shortcuts off the paths. It should save us some time.”

Pike nodded, easily agreeing, “Sounds a fair assessment to me.”

Lupin was slower to respond, “We can’t very well leave our clansmen unaware, I suppose.”

Sycamore breathed a sigh of relief. He had worried Lupin would offer pushback no matter the suggestion, but it seemed the bully was either too dazed to disagree or reasonable enough to see sense. Sycamore suspected the former.

-----

The vineyard seemed deserted, as the rest had been. They had swept through a half dozen farms so far, neither finding signs of fighting nor any other members of their clan. Many of the farmers had likely gone to the village to find the source of the smoke, unknowingly walking into danger. The enthusiasm at the idea of uniting with others of their clan had driven them thus far, but that was quickly fading.

“Another empty farm and the Fireglass gets further away with my family and yours, runt.” Lupin’s complaints had picked up after the second farm. Of course, Sycamore had no control over whether they found anyone, but it was only natural for Lupin to yell at Sycamore.

“Do you think I am fond of the image of Jackdaw and my mother in shackles, Lupin?” Sycamore replied, “I’m no happier than you that they’ve been dragged off!”

“Then you’ll agree we should stop wasting our time and start pursuing them before someone we love ends up dead!”

“Enough of such talk!” Pike snapped, “Certainly it’s frustrating, knowing that our families are out there in chains somewhere, but if there’s anyone left here, it’s our duty to find them and help them.” Sycamore and Lupin glared at each other, but Lupin finally nodded.

“You’re right. This situation stresses me to irritability. Apologies, Pike.” Lupin said.

“Apologize to Sycamore, he’s the one you’ve been snipping at.”

Lupin ground his teeth for a moment before forcing out an apology. “I’m sorry, Sycamore.”

Sycamore rubbed at his temple where a headache had risen. “There’s nothing to apologize for,” He finally said, “We’re all irritated from this, and I’m hardly sure of what’s best to do. But we’ve started this search, so we may well finish it.” They continued to look around the vineyard. The compound of the farm was made up of three main buildings: a pair of storehouses and the farmhouse itself. 

“I’ll go through the house, you two check the storage,” Lupin said. They parted ways, splitting to check their own buildings. While he looked through the big storeroom, Sycamore recalled the last time he had been out to this vineyard, to stand by as his mother delivered the couple’s second child. He had offered to help, but his mother had laughed him off, saying he wasn’t quite ready for the intensity of a delivery room. He smiled at the memory, wondering what his mother was doing, whether she was healthy with the rest of the Heartwood clan.   

The storehouse was mostly empty, and Sycamore idly wondered where the wine casks were. Regardless of their whereabouts, he quickly finished his search of the storehouse – predictably with no sign of other Heartwood clansmen. He made to join Pike, but paused when he heard voices approaching the farm. At first, he thought Pike and Lupin must have finished their search faster than he, but quickly he realized the direction was wrong. The voices came not from the other buildings but the direction of the village. 

“Just a few more of these backwater farms, then we’ll be done with this nonsense,” A woman’s husky voice called.

“Twelve farms, and not more than a few prisoners between them,” Another voice, a man’s, said, “I envy Whistler, he’s probably catching a nap back in the village.” Sycamore quietly peeked an eye out of the storehouse. A pair of the raiders, with their black and red armor and conical helmets, were leisurely approaching the farm.

“I’ll never understand how you can sleep around smoke and corpses,” The woman replied, “a whiff of the dead and I can’t fall asleep for hours.”

“Not too many corpses this time, remember. That windy hag made sure of that.” It took Sycamore a moment to realize they were speaking of his mother, and he bristled at the description of her. But it was not the time for such worries.

“Quiet now, or they’ll hear our approach,” The woman said.

“What’s the point? There’s likely no one here anyway,” the man whined.

“If you want to complain to the Cinderwhip, feel free. I value my life, so quiet down. Besides, this looks to be a vineyard, so we can hope to find a pot of wine or two.” From there, their voices fell low enough that Sycamore could not make out their words. 

Sycamore’s heart raced in his chest. Their plan was made as such to avoid a confrontation with the Fireglass, but it seemed the wind blew them into danger once again. The pair of raiders drew closer to the buildings, eventually splitting up. The woman made her way towards the farmhouse, the man towards the other storehouse. 

Sycamore momentarily battled with indecision over who to help before slowly following after the man. If Pike’s storehouse was anything like Sycamore’s, there would be few spots to hide compared to the farmhouse. He just hoped that Lupin would not be seized by his revenge and attack the woman raider before they could come provide help.

Careful to make no noise, he popped out of his storehouse, stepping his way over to Pike’s. When he heard shouting, he discarded quiet, rushing forwards to provide support. He burst through the door to find Pike grappling on the ground with the raider. The man’s sword was still sheathed, and it looked as if Pike had ambushed him. They rolled around on the ground wrestling and throwing fists at each other, but it only took a glance to see that Pike was the weaker of the two.

Sycamore felt a moment of indecisive panic. He could try to latch onto the raider, but he was a weak grappler and would probably end up getting himself killed. His sling, too, was no use in a situation like this, as he would likely as not hit his friend if he tried to use it. He remembered, finally, that he had a sword strapped to himself. He yanked it free from the scabbard, holding the hilt in both hands. He’d scarcely ever held a sword before that day, let alone used one.

On the ground, the raider had taken control of the fight, pinning Pike beneath him. He had an arm across Pike’s neck, and was grabbing at his sheathed sword. Seizing the moment, Sycamore swung his sword in an overhand chop down onto the raider’s back. Shock shot into his arms from the blade, and it leapt from his hands. He felt the cut bite into the raider’s leather armor, but the angle was off, and it did not cut deep. It was enough to throw off the man’s balance, though, and Pike managed to free a leg enough to prop a kick against the man’s stomach, sending him rolling to the side. The raider let out a cry of outrage and pain, but quickly rose to his feet.

Sycamore scrambled to grab the dropped sword from the ground. He got a hand on it, but as he lifted it, the raider stepped up, cracking him in the side of the head with a gauntleted fist, sending him sprawling. Lights danced in his eyes as he struggled to regain his focus, pushing himself back to his feet. He heard Pike let out an outraged cry followed by the wet sound of a weapon entering flesh. Finally, Sycamore eyes cleared to see the raider, red foam bubbling from his mouth, stuck in the neck with Pike’s spear.

The raider mouthed silent curses, but nothing came out besides a frothy mix of blood and spittle, dripping to the floor as he scraped at his neck grabbing at the head of the spear that was buried there.

Pike let out a final grunt of effort, pushing on the spear once again. With a squelch, Sycamore saw the tip prod out the back of the raider’s neck, strength disappearing from his limbs as life fled from his eyes. The man collapsed to the ground, and Pike tugged on the spear, freeing it with a wet noise from the body, now lying in a slowly growing pool of dark blood.

“Thanks for the timely rescue, Sycamore,” Pike said between pants, eyes flicking between the bloody head of his spear and the dead man’s mangled neck.

“Always a pleasure-” Sycamore started, cutting off with a wince when he poked a hand at where the raider had struck him. He tried again. “Always a pleasure to throw a punch for a friend.” He felt blood dripping down the side of his head, and a daze lingered over his senses. He shook his head to try to clear his mind, but the fog remained.

“Come on,” He said, “There were two of the raiders, let’s go make sure Lupin yet lives.”

“Hm? Ah, yes. Lupin, right,” Pike said, tearing his focus away from the corpse he had just made. Sycamore empathized, but they had little time to reflect. Sycamore was surprised the other Fireglass raider hadn’t followed their shouts; he worried she’d found Lupin. He hoped it was just luck, though. If the woman had joined in their fight, chances are neither Sycamore nor Pike would still be breathing.

They entered the farmhouse to the sound of a loud crash. Sycamore uttered a curse, rushing to the source of the sound, Pike close behind him. They pushed through a few rooms before entering into the kitchen, where the fighting had just come to a close. Lupin was panting, sword hanging limply in his hand. In front of him, sprawled on the ground, lay the other raider. Her helmet had a long, crumpled dent in it, and gore dripped down her head. Over her stood a stocky woman, wearing a stout linen dress and holding a thick iron pry bar.

The trio of boys found themselves, after the corpse of the raider had been moved off, quickly sat at a table, bread and bowls of stew placed in front of them.

“You’ll have to forgive that the stew is cold,” The woman said, “With the smoke, my husband had us put out the cook fire and stow ourselves in the wine cellar.”

“Don’t worry, Mrs. Maple, I did not even notice,” Sycamore said between bites. With one hand, he held a cloth to his head to stem the bleeding of his head wound. With the other, a hunk of bread he took greedy bites from. He had not even realized how hungry he was until he smelled the food she put out. From the look of the way Pike and Lupin ate, they were the same as him.

“Take your time with the food, but I’d like you to explain exactly what is going on,” Mrs. Maple said, “I’d like to know who I just killed.” That gave Sycamore brief pause. She was a sturdy woman, built with the common strength of a farmer, but when Sycamore studied her face, there were hints that her composure frayed. Worry wrinkled her forehead, and the edges of her mouth were tight to conceal a frown.

“I can give you an explanation of what happened, though most of it is secondhand from Lupin, if he wants to explain,” Sycamore said. He looked at the other boy, who nodded him off. He was too consumed with his meal to do the talking, it seemed.

A short explanation later, and Mrs. Maple’s worry had turned to shock. 

“The village razed...” She said in a hushed voice, “The Fireglass returned...” She turned to Lupin suddenly, “You didn’t happen to see Swift, did you. My husband, was he-”

Lupin shook his head.

“I can tell you he’s not among the dead,” Sycamore said, “I searched the village before I came upon Lupin, and though I found many bodies, your husband was not among them.”

She let out a deep, shaky sigh, and Sycamore saw the shock on her face fall to resignation, then form to resolve.

“Just typical of him to leave the kids with me when he goes to get himself captured,” She said with renewed strength.

“Your kids, are they alright?” Pike asked.

“Should still be napping,” Mrs. Maple said with a nod, “I put them down with some lavender tea when Hickory started complaining that they wanted to run around outside. They might’ve woken with the ruckus up here, but my Pa is down with them in the cellar, he should keep them breathing. I’d fetch them, but I don’t want them to see the blood on the ground.”

Sycamore thought back to when he had visited this Vineyard to deliver Maple’s baby three years before. It was her second child, a girl named Mist. At the time, her son, Hickory was two, which would put him at five. Sycamore winced. Yes, it would not do for them to see such tragedy at such a young age.

“How did you end up at my vineyard, then?” She asked, taking their now empty dishes and giving them a quick wash.

“After we met up, Sycamore had the idea to check with the farms to see if anyone was left here. A good idea, in the end,” Pike said, smacking Sycamore on the shoulder.

“So, looking for us, you ran into a few more of those raiders here. I’d thank you, then. I was able to take that woman by surprise as she danced with Lupin around our table, but otherwise I’m not sure how I would have fared against two of them.”

“I’m just happy we found someone,” Sycamore said, “If we hadn’t I would’ve cursed myself for wasting this time.”

“It’s never a waste of time to look out for friends,” Mrs. Maple said as she finished her washing and dried her hands. “But that does call to mind the question. What do you boys plan to do now?”

The three boys shared a look, and Lupin spoke, “Obviously, we’ll be pursuing the Fireglass. We can harry them, maybe take down enough that we can muster an escape attempt with the prisoners.” He coughed after he finished speaking. After his brief altercation with the raider earlier, he looked rough, coughing, panting, and often losing himself to dizziness.

“You can hardly stand up straight, let alone track a band of raiders. We need to rest, recover, then determine a course of action,” Pike said.

“Mrs. Maple, what will you do?” Sycamore asked. All his plans had been made assuming they wouldn’t find anyone. Now that they had found Maple and her family, those earlier plans had to be discarded.

“We’ll make due. Obviously, we can’t stay here, but I won’t leave the dead of our clan unburied in the village. So I’ll hide away somewhere for a few days with my family then get to work.”

Sycamore felt a pang of shame when he realized he had not even considered properly disposing of the bodies.

“We’ll help you,” Sycamore firmly said. Pike, after a pause, nodded his agreement, but Lupin glared at him.

He rose to his feet, scowling at Pike and Sycamore. “I do not know what possesses you to decide for me, runt.” His words were slurred, he swayed on his feet. “Perhaps because you two managed to muster a few bodies between you, you suddenly think yourselves better than me. But I won’t hear of your cowardice! You can’t stop me, I’m going to track them and free my family one way or...” His words slowly trailed off before he finally fainted, collapsing back on his chair.

“He lost a lot of blood today,” Sycamore said, sighing, “I warned him he needs to rest. I’m finally beginning to understand my mother’s words about ‘fool's honor’.” 

“I find Aunt Poppy’s words offer more wisdom every day,” Mrs. Maple said with a sad smile towards Lupin, “His bravery is admirable, but some control and rest will do him good.”

“Mrs. Maple is right, though, Sprout. We can’t stay here, even if she’d have us. We need to find a place to avoid their searches until they leave.”

Sycamore pondered the question a moment before an idea struck him. He nearly smacked himself in the forehead, it was so obvious. He did some mental measurements before nodding to himself. Certainly, seven people would be a tight fit, but they’d have to make do. He only hoped the Magus was telling the truth about being a hospitable host.
