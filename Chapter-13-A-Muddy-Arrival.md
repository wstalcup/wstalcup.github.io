_A ruined village poked out of the fields. The buildings were crumbled. I judged, based on our location, that the village was an early casualty to the Brush Wars, nearly the furthest east the Kingdoms had ever settled. As we walked among the ruins, the boy asked me of the cities of the Kingdoms. I told him of my home, of the capital. I mentioned the Sparrow Manors, the Great Games, of the palace and its centuries of history. Sensitive as I was, I avoided mention of the royal family or the nobility themselves. He smiled at my words and said that he very much would like to visit one day._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

Travelers became a regular sighting the next day. Sycamore was shocked when he saw the first family, a pair of children piled in a mule-drawn wagon loaded with all sorts of possessions as their parents walked in front. The wagon had a crooked axel and moved with a sway over the gravel road. There was a grim air about them, and they walked at a sedate, tired pace, avoiding anything beyond muttered greetings as Sycamore’s group passed them.

From then, they began to see more and more folk along the road. Some were alone, some traveled in groups. They came from the small branching paths that split off from the West Road, winding through wood and hill to villages much like the Heartwood’s. All looked tired, and all walked towards Whitebrook. 

Sycamore had worried, briefly, that they would look suspicious in their ragged, bloodstained clothes. They had packed lightly, and no amount of scrubbing in a stream would remove the rusty stains from a punctured artery. It was a naïve worry; many they passed were similarly ragged, injured and stained with whatever hardships had led them to their tired flight east.

Following the fight in the camp, things became distant with Granite. Mrs. Maple scolded him until his ears turned red on the burdens of watching over children, but ultimately she forgave him with the rest. Still, Sycamore felt a wall had been built around the man, a wall of betrayed expectations and exposed secrets. He continued to help with chores and such, but during meals he met conversation with silent scowls.

Contrary to this, Perch and Marrow seemed liberated by the revelations about their past. Marrow continued to teach Lupin swordplay, approaching the lessons with newfound gusto and even inviting Sycamore to join. He had done so once, but the other boy’s off-putting aggression had scared him off joining again. The training served as an outlet for Lupin, a way of expressing his frustrations physically. Sycamore’s bruises from their spars spoke to the intensity of those emotions. 

Instead of joining the lessons, Sycamore passed the time with Perch and Pike, sharing stories and memories as they practiced with their slings. It was a refreshing distraction from the uncertainty of the future. At that moment, Sycamore could not help himself from giggling as Pike finished his account.

“So with that, Trout distracted Ma while I made off with the seed cakes. By the time she spotted the thievery, we were long gone. She gave us a proper tongue lashing when we showed our faces at home, but Trout always says that few things sooth the burn of a scolding like a full stomach,” Pike said proudly while spinning up a stone and loosing it towards a thick, old pine stump – their current target. He clicked his tongue when his aim was off and the stone flew wide. His was a childish tale of their youths, told with embellishment to Perch and anyone else who would listen. It was a fond memory for Sycamore, mostly because he’d been offered a portion of one of the seed cakes.

“Your mother sounds to be a woman of supreme character,” Perch said lightly, the smallest hint of indictment in her tone. She launched her own stone, smirked when it was on target, and turned to Sycamore with intense eyes, “What of you, Sycamore? While Pike’s stories entertain, they remind me greatly of my own childhood. I’m sure the son of a healer has a host of tales to tell.” 

Sycamore had learned much of Perch from her own stories. She was the daughter of a shepherd, the youngest of four children. Her eldest sister was married and set to inherit the flock when her parents settled down. Her two older brothers had married within their village. She, seized by a wanderlust unique in her family, had skipped her apprenticeship to join a band of mercenaries. For years, she flitted between groups before ending up hired as a merchant’s guard. It was a far different life than anyone in Sycamore’s village.

Grabbing a stone off the ground, he carefully weighed it. He slid the well-sized stone into his sling’s cradle, gave his sling a twirl and launched it, nodding when his aim was true. Finally, he responded to her question with a huff of forced laughter, “I may have tales, but most of them are not the sort to be told lightly. I could describe injuries and ailments I’ve seen, but there’s enough of that about without me supplying more.” He nodded apologetically at the woman. She looked to want to press him further, but Pike supplanted her requests with another story, a tale of when Trout, Sycamore, and he had whipped their clan into a fervor by disappearing into the Songwood for two days – they had planned to start a village of their own until hunger drove them home.

Since recovering from her near-death injury, Perch had looked at Sycamore with different eyes. It was more than thankfulness he saw, but fervor. He felt an uncomfortable familiarity with the way she gazed at him, but could not place it.

When Pike’s story ended, they decided to rejoin the rest of the group to help with dinner preparations. Perch turned back to Sycamore as they began their walk, “Tell me, Sycamore, in our fight against the bandits, was it you who threw the ash into their eyes? Marrow spoke as if it were a miracle. What else can you do?” Sycamore blinked in surprise, recalling his maneuver with the wind.

“Yes, our Sprout here is quite talented,” Pike said before Sycamore could respond, “He’s always been bright, but recently he’s shown to be a bundle of surprises. The way he throws around the air, some impressive stuff.”

Sycamore smiled half-heartedly. He had no concept of how talented he was with Speaking. Necessity, boredom, and desperation had grown his abilities greatly since the attack on the village, but still his strength was of no comparison to the stories told of his mother.

“It’s called Speaking with the Wind,” Sycamore said, “My elder brother taught me, though our mother is the truly talented one. I’m hardly strong enough for it to be practical in combat, but, I suppose, circumstances provided an opportunity that night.”

Perch’s eyes twinkled as she looked at him. “I’ve heard of such things among the elemental orders and high ranking members of large clans. This far west, though, it’s almost unheard of.”

“My mom was once a Priestess of the Wind,” Sycamore said softly. To speak of his mother brought feelings of guilt, especially next to his use of his Speaking for violence. She had scolded him harshly on misusing the ability. With the bandits it was in defense, no doubt, but still, he could vividly picture her disappointed frown.

“Your mother, a priestess? But I thought they couldn’t-” Perch started, before cutting off, perhaps fearing some rudeness.

Sycamore answered the unspoken question, guessing at her confusion. “My brother and I were orphans, taken in by my mother. She considers it an exception to her oaths, though I expect the only truly exceptional thing is her stubbornness,” Sycamore said with a fond smile.

“Yes, Aunt Poppy is a bit of a whirlwind, isn’t she?” Pike said with nostalgia. He and his brother had nearly as many memories of her scoldings as Sycamore.

“I apologize if I’ve caused any offense,” Perch said, frowning slightly, “I should have guessed considering your Westfolk blood, but my curiosity got the better of me.” 

“That’s one thing I can’t quite understand,” Pike said, “This business of Hillfolk and Westfolk. Sycamore looks a bit different, yeah, and he doesn’t have the strength and speed of most folk our age, but beyond that, is there much to fuss about? As far as I can see, he looks a bit odd but is otherwise just the same.” Sycamore flushed at the frank description, ‘a bit odd,’ but he had to admit it was not far off, with his small hands, black hair, and green eyes.

Perch paused her steps, giving Pike a sideways look. “I’ve been wondering for some time, now, but is your clan not too casual about Sycamore being of the Westfolk? I understand you accept him easily, but anyone from so far west must have some memory of the old Plains Wars.”

Pike and Sycamore shared a look of confusion. Pike spoke for them, “I can’t say I’ve ever heard more than a name of these Plains Wars, but what does that have to do with the Westfolk?”

Incredulity showed on Perch’s face, “You speak as if you’ve travelled far from the west, which would put your village very close to the old front. How could you not know of those bloody wars? Mrs. Maple may not be old enough to recall them, but her father certainly is. The chaos of those times should be well known among the elder of your clan.”

Sycamore understood the confusion quickly. “Our village is young; our clan came to where we now live no more than twenty years ago. Before that we were far to the east, perhaps beyond the reach of your Plains Wars.”

Perch nodded at his explanation, but some confusion remained on her face. She spoke with a frown, “I did not realize Hillfolk lands were so large that such a place existed.”

Pike shrugged. “Maybe not, but our clan has a speckled history when it comes to violence, and it may be not ignorance as much as avoidance of such a grim topic.”

Perch hummed thoughtfully before responding, “It seems recently fate has been cruel to you, then, to bring so much violence to your lives.”

Sycamore grunted agreement, dark memories dancing at the edge of his perception.

“This still doesn’t explain the significance of Sycamore’s Westfolk heritage,” Pike said, brows furrowed.

Perch nodded as she explained, “To many, especially the young, there will be no significance. It will be a point of curiosity, but nothing beyond that. Some older Hillfolk you meet will have memories of those old wars. Bloody years fighting over rocky land that remains mostly wilderness, claimed by both Westfolk and Hillfolk. Marrow fought in the wars, forty years back, and still holds some grudge against any Westfolk he meets.” Sycamore recalled how the old man’s eyes had burned when they first met.

“I have never met another Westfolk in my life,” Sycamore complained, “I didn’t even know I was one until a month ago. To hold me accountable is anything but fair.”

Perch smiled sadly at him, “I accept that explanation, as does Marrow, I believe. But it may not be enough for some. You will find quickly, that when it comes to hatred and grudges, fairness does not often hold value.”

Perch’s words sunk to the pit of Sycamore’s stomach like heavy stones. From the next morning, he walked with his cloak’s hood drawn over his head, concealing his features.

On the final day of their journey to Whitebrook, the road began to widen. All at once there was a swarm of activity, long trains of wagons, families and caravans in a slow drift towards the city. Sycamore and his companions weaved through the traffic as it navigated the gravel road. The ground, soft and muddy from heavy use, caught on wagon wheels and sucked at boots as they drew nearer to Whitebrook.

Most of the travelers were too self-possessed to pay any attention to them as they pushed on. Occasionally, frustrated drivers would yell curses at them as they moved past stuck wagons. To see so many in transit spoke volumes of the state of the western realm. By Perch’s accounting, she had never seen so many travelers on the West Road. Sycamore knew they must have been fleeing something, refugees from the wanton destruction that haunted Sycamore’s dreams. He worried the city would have no room for the problems of the Heartwood clan.

Just past midday, as the road bent around a tall hill, the city of Whitebrook finally came into view. 

-----

Sycamore wiggled his toes uncomfortably, mud squelching between them. Sometime on the road, the sole of his boot had worn through, and as they stood, waiting to enter the city, grime flowed through the hole.

The line for the checkpoint extended far behind them, full of people anxiously waiting to plead their case for entry into the city. They’d been waiting for hours as they grew accustomed to the state of things outside of Whitebrook.

The first thing Sycamore had noticed when he joined the line the stench of mud and animal dung. The West Road resembled a swamp this close to the city proper, and pack animals brayed and yelped, crowding the air with the sounds and odors of a barnyard. A shantytown grew like a fungus off the road, a sea of ramshackle huts filled with hundreds of refugees.

Sycamore had never seen so many people in his life. His eyes widened like saucers as he took in the crowds through his cloak’s cowl. He was in awe that so many hundreds of people could gather in one place without suffocating. 

“Next in line!” A voice called, setting off the slow shuffle of the queue. Only a handful of people stood between them and the checkpoint, and a nervousness had started to build in Sycamore’s stomach. People were turned away as often as they were allowed into the city, their faces despondent as they stepped off the road into the forest of shanties. He had no idea what they would ask, what was required to enter into the city. What would they do if they were turned away? Sycamore swallowed, hoping he would not have to learn the answer to that question.

“Next!” The voice called again, and Sycamore realized his fears had distracted him from the last few moments of waiting, and it was finally their turn. They stepped forward through the mud up to a sturdy oaken table with a man seated behind it. He wore armor but was frail of appearance, just past middle age and holding a pen delicately in his hand. On the desk in front of him was a sheaf of paper alongside a metal lockbox.

He jotted a note down on his paper before looking up at Sycamore’s group. His face was schooled to perfect neutrality as he looked them over. His eyes finally settled on Granite, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly.

“Granite, is that you?” He said. His eyes looked Sycamore’s group over once more.

“Moss,” Granite said with a grin, “It seems they’re keeping you miserable.”

“That would be Administrator Moss,” he admonished, humor in his tone, “It’s good to see you, man, though I dare say you look more miserable than me”

“There’s a kind way to welcome an old friend back from his travels. Can you not tell me I look good for my age?”

“You know I wouldn’t lie to you,” the Administrator said. His eyes once again looked over Sycamore’s group. “Let’s save the banter for when business is finished. Are these all residents of Whitebrook?”

“These two are,” Granite replied, gesturing at Marrow and Perch, “The others are traveling companions.”

“Refugees,” Moss said before looking over to Marrow and Perch, “I’ll have to verify the census. Your names?”

“Perch Arach.”

“Spruce Traid.” Sycamore blinked. He hadn’t realized Marrow was not his real name.

Administrator Moss flipped through the census, scanning it with squinted eyes. After a moment he looked up with a nod. “Welcome back to Whitebrook, Perch, Spruce.”

“What about us?” Lupin said impatiently. 

Moss turned to him with a level look. “Patience, boy, and thinks will be done sooner.” Sycamore saw Lupin clench his jaw, but he offered no protest.

Suddenly Moss spoke, “You, with the cloak, pull down your hood. I’ll need to see your face if you want to pass by.”

Sycamore hesitated a moment, but pulled the heavy wool of the cloak back, revealing his face. Moss’s eyes widened slightly, the first sign of emotion on his face since recognizing Granite. For a third time, his eyes scanned over Sycamore’s group, looking upon them with more interest.

“What clan do you hail from?” He asked.

“Heartwood,” Mrs. Maple said. Hickory and Mist stood beside her, holding her hands as they drew endless amusement from stomping around in the mud.

Moss looked from her back to his census, flipping through the pages with a puzzled look on his face. Finally, he reached near the end of the document, tapping a finger on his desk before responding.

“That’s right, the Heartwood branch that came west. You’re an elusive lot. Well, what’s your story, then?”

“What do you think?” Lupin burst out, “The Fireglass came to our village, destroyed it, took our clan captive, and now we’re held at the gate by a puffed-up beurocrat asking inane questions!” Sycamore winced at the boy’s tone, worried that Moss might send them off out of anger.

Contrary to this expectation, the administrator showed hardly any emotion on his face, studying Lupin. 

“I understand your frustration, but it’s part of my job to collect information from the refugees. Regardless, it will be two silver marks each to enter the city.”

“Two silver marks?” Mrs. Maple burst out. Sycamore had little concept of how much money that was, but from the look on her face, it was quite expensive.

“Each,” Moss confirmed with a nod.

“That’s a steep toll,” Granite said, “I’ve never heard of anything like that.”

“Look around you, man,” Moss replied, “we have thousands of refugees clamoring to get into the city. There’s hardly room for them in Whitebrook. The toll is steep, yes, but also necessary.”

“We can’t afford that, Administrator Moss,” Mrs. Maple said, voice distraught, “I have some money, but not enough for my family, let alone all seven of us.” She turned to Lupin, Pike, and Sycamore. “Did any of you pack money?”

Sycamore shook his head. They hardly used money day to day in the Heartwood clan. He understood the meaning and value of currency, of course, but they only ever used it when trading with members of another clan. His mother always said that money was not needed when trust would suffice.

After Lupin and Pike similarly answered in the negative, she looked back to Moss. “I’m afraid we can’t afford it.”

“Then I’m afraid I cannot allow you to pass,” He said simply. There was no regret in his voice, only reality.

“Is this because I’m Westfolk?” Sycamore suddenly asked. The question of prejudice had lingered on his mind since Moss reacted to his face.

The administrator studied him a long moment before responding. “No, it has nothing to do with that. This is the same rate for all refugees to Whitebrook. Bureaucracy does not hold old grudges.” Sycamore studied the man’s face, looking for a lie. Finally, he nodded, hoping Moss told them the truth. If they were to be held back, Sycamore did not want it to be on account of him.

“Is there another way into the city?” Pike asked, the last vestige of his optimism clinging to his voice.

“Not unless you can find a member of the Whitebrook council to be your sponsor,” Moss said.

“And can we speak to one of them?” Mrs. Maple asked hopefully.

“I’m afraid the council are too busy to deal with every refugee seeking asylum,” Moss said. 

“Granite, say something!” Perch said. She looked between Moss and her companion, her eyes pleading.

Granite scowled at Perch but spoke. “The boy saved her life,” he said, pointing at Sycamore, “And the others fought shoulder to shoulder with me. Is there nothing you can do?”

A sigh escaped Moss’s lips before he responded to Granite. “I have heard many stories of terror and heroism these past weeks, old friend. Unfortunately, the price set is not a life saved or a loved one lost, but two silver marks. I can’t negotiate on that.”

“You can’t expect us to simply walk away!” Lupin cried, “Our village is burned, our families are taken. We came here to seek aid, not to be turned away!”

“That’s exactly what I expect,” Moss said, the slightest hint of frustration peeking into his voice, “Look around you, boy. Thousands swarm to the city, and they all have similar, tragic stories to tell. Do you think yours is the only village burned? Yours the only family taken? Crowds surround you in despair and you moan for me to twist the rules. I cannot do it, and I will not do it. Please, move along or I will ask the guards to remove you.” He paused, schooling his voice back to neutrality, “I suggest you rent a roof out here. Looking at the sky, a storm is coming, and I would not like the children to be caught in the rain.”
