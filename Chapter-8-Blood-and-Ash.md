_We came upon a stag, one day, wandering out of a copse. It was a big thing, ten points at least. Quick as a whip, the boy undid his belt, unfurling it to reveal a sling. He scraped up a stone from the ground, and in the span of a few breaths was whirling it with great speed. A flick of his wrist and the stone flew, faster than I could track. Next I saw, a stone-sized welt appeared between the stag’s eyes, and it collapsed, dead. Without a word, he redid his belt, moving to attend to the corpse he just made._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

Two days before the coming hunt, Sycamore found himself getting frustrated with the Magus’s training. The daily lessons had taught him quite a bit about the nature of the soul. They had hit a wall, though, when Sycamore revealed he had never tried to sense his own soul. He had learned how to sense others’ through his Healer’s Touch, and since he knew he should never heal himself, he hadn’t seen it necessary to practice the ability on his own essence. That was not good enough for the Magus, who claimed that understanding one’s soul was as critical to soul magic as understanding your body is to walking.

So Sycamore practiced the skill as he returned home from his lesson. Days of practice had shown it was not beyond him, but it still felt like viewing the whole process upside-down. He was unused to the perspective and it disoriented him. He had tried to ask his mother for hints to help him, but she warned him off from it, saying it would only tempt him to heal himself if he became too comfortable looking at his own essence. Her warning had come with a puzzled look, and Sycamore suspected she had begun to notice his afternoon absences. She likely wondered where he was going and from where these questions came. He was working up the courage to tell her of the Magus and his teaching. In part of his mind, he feared his mother would forbid him from going to visit the man, which he did not want. So, the secret remained.

His distracted walking north was interrupted when he suddenly felt something was off. For a moment, he could not place the feeling, until he recognized the smell of ash on the wind. To the north, he saw smoke drifting into the air, coming from the direction of the village. With a feeling of dread, he increased his pace, his walk turning to a jog and a run as his worries grew. 

When he reached the outskirts of the village, the first thing he noticed was a corpse. A slash through the gut, a stab through the neck. Blood pooled around the body, mixing with the dirt into a vile mud. He recognized a bitter old man who rarely spared a kind word to anyone. Briefly, Sycamore recalled that the old man had not thanked his mother when she healed his hand, cut while sharpening his scythe. He was dead now, his body cooling in the afternoon sunlight. 

Sycamore crouched to touch the body. It was cool. The blood, too, was clotted, sticky. This had happened hours before. Shock and panic warred with analysis. He wanted to sprint home, scream for his mother, but instinct told him to move slow and quiet. He did not know who had done this, or if they were still about. He left the body there, on the ground. It felt wrong to do so, but he had to know the full situation. He mouthed a silent prayer as he moved on that the wind would guide the old man to peace.

His sling came off his waist easily, and he gathered up a handful of well-sized stones, sliding them into his waist-pouch. He moved towards the central village where his home lay, mutely processing the devastation he saw. Some buildings had crumbled to piles of charred lumber, others still burned. Some seemed unscathed in the destruction. When he could, Sycamore checked each building. In some he found signs of fighting, toppled furniture or blood on the ground. In one, a severed hand. He found a handful of corpses as well. He had memories of all of them.

He paused as he drew nearer to the center of the village, nearer to his home. He did not know what he would find, but the state of the village robbed him of any hope. Each corpse he found he feared to see his mother’s stern expression, his brother’s easy smile. 

Sycamore heard the man before he saw him, singing a jaunty tune. He sang a melody of drinking and fighting, killing and burning. Sycamore slowed his steps, carefully moving towards the voice. He popped his head around a bend and spotted a tall man, dressed in thick leather armor dyed red and black. His helmet, a cone of iron, was cast to the side of him on the ground. 

He was urinating on what remained of Sycamore’s home.

Sycamore’s mind went blank when he saw the pile of timber, blackened and smoking, where his house once was. He wanted to scream his grief and outrage, but his instincts roared at him to keep silent. He studied the man closely, desperately ignoring the song of torching a village and killing its inhabitants. Sycamore numbly recalled the corpse on the ground, an old man with an ill temper, slashed and stabbed.

Sycamore felt himself start to whirl the sling, mind racing. Earlier, the Magus had asked if he could move against the threat himself. His home, burned to the ground. Days before, his mother warned him of violence, made him promise not to be consumed. The sling gained speed, and Sycamore felt the momentum of the stone, the weight of it as he whirled it. His brother once told him that some used Speaking to improve their aim with slings and bows. Sycamore was not skilled enough to form a tunnel of wind to direct his stone, but in his practice, he found he could use Speaking to remove any crosswind. His ability’s range was not long, though, maybe thirty paces. Sycamore took a guess that the man stood twenty-five away.

Sycamore felt for the wind, and found it all around, embers of torched houses pulling and pushing the air with their heat. He took a deep breath, resisting the urge to cough when some smoke came with the air into his lungs. Despite his shock and grief, the connection to the wind came easily. He coaxed the wind to calmness, and the air around him stilled. In front of him, the armed man reached the height of a chorus, but paused when he noticed the falling wind. He looked to the left, the right, and finally turned around, spotting Sycamore.

“What’s this then? A Westfolk boy? Follow the smoke, did you?” The man scratched at in itch, spat to the side.

“Where is my mother?” Sycamore said. His voice came out in a tremble, with all the authority of a scared child.

“I can’t say I’ve seen any other Westfolk about, son,” The man said. He seemed to finally notice that Sycamore had his sling in hand. “Why don’t you drop that thing and we can talk in peace.”

“The woman and man from the house behind you,” Sycamore said, “Where are they?”

The man stared at him for a long moment before responding. He raised his hands in a gesture of peace. “So you’re of the Heartwood, then? Drop the sling and I’ll take you to where your clan is.”

“Where are they?” Sycamore asked again.

“I told you to drop that thing! Do it, or I’ll gut you like a fish!” He snarled.

“Answer my question.” Sycamore’s voice had calmed. 

The man let out a wordless yell. He started dashing towards Sycamore, grabbing at the sword sheathed at his waist. A few steps later, his yell cut off and he collapsed to the ground in a heap. Belatedly, Sycamore realized he’d loosed his sling. He released his connection to the wind, felt a cool breeze on his face. Taking a deep breath, he tried to calm a sudden bout of dizziness. He slowly walked towards the man, who lay face down on the ground. Sycamore was having trouble controlling his breathing, and his heart was beating erratically.

He came upon the man and, fearing some kind of trick, grabbed the sword off the ground. Leveraging with his foot, he flipped the man over. The sword tumbled from Sycamore’s hand. The man’s eye socket was collapsed where the stone had struck him. His eye had burst, and blood oozed out of the wound. Spittle and gore had mixed with dirt, caking his face with dark mud. Sycamore looked at the man, dead by his hand, for a moment before turning to the side and vomiting.

-----

He left the body on the ground, there, next to a pile of vomit, but he took the sword. He did not know if he would come upon another of the raiders, but he suspected that where there was one, there would be more. Necessity of action forestalled processing that he’d just killed a man, and he continued searching through the village. He found more corpses, more torched houses, but no one else alive. Despair at the state of things and a sense of intense loneliness slowed his movements to a lethargic pace. 

He came to the Aivis forge. The building was constructed of stone, and so was mostly intact compared to many around it. Sycamore stepped into the forge, recalling his misery from working the bellows. The forge was cool now, and blood pooled on the ground. There, at the center of the pool of blood, propped against a table, sat Lupin.

Sycamore paused when he saw the face of the larger boy grimacing, a smear of red on one cheek. His hands were clasped over his stomach, caked in blood and covering a gut wound. His sword lay on the ground next to him. Sycamore did not know how to feel upon seeing Lupin in such a situation. He had wished death on the boy many times in his past, but to see it in front of his eyes left him hollow. He was an enemy, yes, but one within the clan, that he knew well. He had healed Lupin’s injuries before, celebrated, laughed, and grieved with him. He recalled how the boy had peaceably worked next to him in the forge. There was a glimmer, there, of the stoic nature of his father, and perhaps that would have eroded the worse parts of his personality as years went by. Years he would not have, now. The despair sunk deeper, and Sycamore struggled to find the motivation to continue his search for life in the village.

He stood there feeling a desperate sense of loneliness, his eyes staring unfocused at Lupin’s corpse. His gaze refocused, though, when he thought he noticed some movement from the boy’s body. There it was, again! A slight shift in Lupin’s hands.

With a surge of life and panic, Sycamore reached out with his Healer’s Touch. Lupin yet lived. His essence was weak, fraying at the edges like an old tapestry, but still some life pulsed within. Scrambling forward, Sycamore knelt next to Lupin, uncaring that his trousers became soaked with blood. He placed his hands aside Lupin’s wound, felt the boy move with a silent groan. He reached out, grabbed the boy’s essence, pulling it carefully to his gut, where bile and blood mixed in a gross combination. The connection was made, and power eked out of Lupin’s essence, slowly sealing the wound, purifying it. It was a precarious thing. Lupin’s essence was weak already from the trauma he’d suffered, but the wound required a great deal of power to heal. And Sycamore could not risk only partly healing it, as the boy was already on death’s door. In the back of his mind, he recalled the description of his grandmother, overdrawn in her healing, comatose until death. Sycamore uttered a silent prayer as Lupin’s wound closed that the boy would not suffer the same fate.

Seconds passed as healing slowly drew power from Lupin’s essence. Where a normal essence was a lake of bright energy, Lupin’s looked like a puddle, shimmering still, but only barely. Finally, the healing finished, and Sycamore let out a tense breath. He sat back on his legs, waiting for some reaction from Lupin. Seconds passed as the boy continued his shallow breaths. Moments flew by, and a renewed sense of despair set in on Sycamore. Why had he  moved so slowly? If he had only been faster, perhaps he could have saved Lupin. He’d felt a glimmer of hope, but now, with the boy comatose, it had been snatched away, leaving him in an even worse state.

Suddenly, Lupin let out a shallow cough. His eyes flicked open, bloodshot and weary. He scanned the room, and they settled on Sycamore.

“Runt? Is that you?” He said in a weak voice.

Sycamore fell forward, clinging to Lupin’s shoulder. He felt tears pouring down his cheeks. Finally, he allowed himself a single wail of despair and hope. Sadness and death surrounded him, but at least he had saved Lupin.

-----

“They came upon the village just after midday,” Lupin said. Sycamore had helped the boy inside his house, away from the forge that stank of death. He helped Lupin change out of his blood-soaked clothes, giving him what food and water remained in the house. He looked haggard. The healing had sealed his wound, but he had lost considerable blood and would be slow to return to full strength.

“Perhaps two hundred of them rode on carts, dragged by stout horses, into the center of the village. My father, hearing the screams, pulled an axe from somewhere and bade me to guard the forge, protect my younger siblings.”

“Who are they?” Sycamore asked. He also replaced his own blood-soaked trousers, borrowing a pair from Lotus, the younger Aivis boy. They were too small by a margin, but better than walking around caked in gore.

“I don’t know,” Lupin said, “Another clan, from the north. I heard my father say ‘fireglass,’ but the name is unfamiliar to me.” Vaguely, Sycamore recalled hearing the name before, but exactly where, he could not place.

Lupin continued, “I was curious, so I peeked my head out of the forge. My sister was crying, my brother worrying after our father’s safety.” He swallowed a mouthful of water. “There was fire around, the raiders throwing torches on houses to create panic and drive people out. They rounded up who they could, throwing shackles on their hand and putting them in the backs of the carts. Anyone who tried to flee, they killed.” Sycamore recalled the old man, stabbed through the neck.

“Minutes of chaos passed before we mounted any kind of defense. My father and your brother joined the fray with a few of the other elders. Jackdaw threw gusts of wind upon the enemy, distracting them while my father and the others smashed through their defenses. They fought hard, beating back the raiders, trying to free some of those taken prisoner. For a moment, I thought they would succeed, but then she stepped forward.”

“Who?” Sycamore felt deep pride that his brother had fought hard, but wondered where his mother had been.

Lupin shook his head, “I don’t know her name, but when she stepped out, the raiders all started chanting ‘Cinderwhip.’ She was tall, thin, her hair cut short. In each hand she held a torch. She swung them around, and the flames grew in length, lashing out at our warriors. They fought hard, but couldn’t compare to her ferocity and precision. My father was the first to fall, struck across the ankles by one of the whips. Your brother went next, taking a lashing across the face trying to protect the others. A moment later and the battle was lost. She said nothing after single-handedly toppling our fiercest warriors, just returning to her cart and patiently waiting.” He grimaced. 

“My brother, is he-” Sycamore cut off, unable to finish the question. None of the corpses he’d found had been of his brother, but if what Lupin said was true, it painted a grim picture.

“No,” Lupin said, “Your brother is not dead. Nor is my father. After the Cinderwhip stepped back, a few of the raiders moved to kill them. They were blown off their feet, though, when a sudden squall of wind burst into the village. A storm, picking up rocks and dust and pressing any who stood against it to the ground, swept through the raiders.” 

“My mother,” Sycamore said. Lupin nodded.

“At the center of the storm stood your mother. She slowly approached the downed defenders, bending over to heal each one as she passed. When she finished, the wind died, and she addressed the raiders.” Lupin scowled harshly, “She demanded to speak to who was in charge. The Cinderwhip stepped forward, torches ready for a fight. Your mother did not wish to fight, though. She offered surrender if they would allow her to heal all of our injured and swear not to harm any other members of the clan.” He spat to the side. “Cowardice.”

“Do not speak of my mother like that,” Sycamore said in a harsh voice. “If she surrendered, it’s because she thought it the best course of action.” 

“You did not see her strength, runt; she could have fought them off, even the Cinderwhip!” 

“Perhaps she could have fought the Cinderwhip, but her strength is not infinite. You said there were two hundred of them. No matter how powerful she is, she would be hard-pressed to fight them off.” Sycamore would not hear insults to his mother, not when she had saved so many lives.

“But still, to surrender...” Lupin muttered.

“You know well as I do that our clan places peace and life above all else. My mother did what she believed was right. That our clan did not fight to the death here leaves hope for their rescue in the future.” A thought suddenly occurred to Sycamore. “Wait, but if you were watching this from the forge, and my mother negotiated a peace, how did you end up with a wound to the gut?”

Even with his anemia, Lupin apparently still had the blood in his body to muster an embarrassed blush. “I refused to accept the surrender, and when they came to round us up in the forge, I struck out with my sword. They parried and stuck me in the gut. Lotus and Lily howled and screamed, but were dragged away, leaving me in a bloody heap on the ground. I suppose they thought me dead, or your mother would have come to heal me. Thankfully you found me before my heart stopped.” Lupin frowned, “Which reminds me, where were you when all this happened, runt? I saw them round up shepherds and farmers, so they must have sent raiders out. How far were you from the village that you evaded their capture?”

“I was to the south-” Sycamore hesitated. Now was not the time to explain the Magus. “Training my Speaking and my sling.”

Lupin nodded, accepting his explanation, “We’ll call it luck, then. For me and you, I suppose.” He scratched at his stomach, where his wound once was. “Thank you, by the way, runt. And I’m sorry about what I said the other day, I just didn’t want to believe that there was any sort of threat.”

Sycamore studied his one-time tormentor, now fellow survivor, wondering if this was genuine reconciliation. The awkwardness on his face was real enough, though, and Sycamore did not have the mental strength to feel hatred towards the only living member of his clan left in the village.

The awkward moment was cut short when they heard the sound of footsteps outside the house. Lupin and Sycamore made sharp eye contact, and Lupin silently heaved himself to his feet. He winced, unsteady, but grabbed his sword, nodding his readiness to Sycamore. Sycamore reached out, connected to the wind, and dropped a stone in the cradle of his sling. They silently made their way out of the house. Sycamore paused before throwing open the door, and Lupin shakily dashed out of the door, Sycamore close behind him. Sycamore’s shock at what he saw was so great that his connection to the wind snapped in disbelief.

“Pike?” Sycamore called.

There, standing in the middle of the street, shepherd’s crook clasped in shaky hands, stood one of the twins. He jumped in shock at Sycamore’s words, but, recognizing the voice, turned towards Lupin and Sycamore.

“Now there’s a pair of familiar faces!” Pike said, grinning wide.
