_When the boy took to something, he picked it up quickly. He was a fast learner, sharp as a razor and quick as a whip. My companion was awed at his quickly growing ability with the sword, but he brushed off her praise thinking it baseless. He was haunted by something, a burden or a memory, a grudge against himself. He was never satisfied. Those feelings, perhaps, are part of what motivated such fast growth._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

Evening had come on their second day in Mistfield when Sycamore finally emerged from the tent. Despite his prolonged period of rest, he felt drained of energy, drained of emotion.

He made brief eye contact with his friends in Marrow’s squad, but none spoke to him. Sycamore had not been in the mood for words since the battle, and their fondness for him seemed to respect that.

_They are surely worried that you still remain silent,_ The Magus said, a tinge of annoyance to his voice. Sycamore knew he was not truly concerned for the others, but rather annoyed at Sycamore’s moodiness. Still, he could not deny the truth of the words.

“What’s for-” He started, breaking off in a cough. His throat was dry from disuse. He tried again, “What’s for dinner?”

Pike stared at him from where he was, hunched over a stew pot. Concern oozed from his expression, and he spoke in a comforting tone, “The usual fare, grains and vegetables. The supply train finally arrived this morning, so it should be a bit more filling.”

“Good. My stomach aches with hunger,” Sycamore said, rubbing at his gut. An image flashed in his mind, intestines spilling out of a gash in the abdomen. He tried to suppress it, but felt queasy nonetheless. He had not eaten much since the battle, not had the appetite.

He took a spot by the fire, ignoring the weight of the gazes of Marrow’s squad. Following the battle, he had scrubbed himself clean of the grime of death and disappeared into isolation. Sister Quartz had found him to debrief. She apologized for sending with him only the weakest speakers – an explanation for why their strength faltered so easily – and thanked him for healing Ashwood. The woman herself had followed, offering him gratefulness with earnest eyes. Many had come to express their thanks to Sycamore, though their words only reminded him of those he chose not to heal, those who died waiting for him. He’d fled from their thanks, hiding among Marrow’s squad.

“How are you, Sycamore?” Juniper finally asked, her tone delicate. He looked up at her, feeling a rush of shame at the concern on her face. They had all gone through the same battle, but here he was, object of their worries.

“I’m fine,” He replied, forcing a smile. There was no joy in it, but perhaps they would not notice. “Better than many.” She looked at him a moment more before nodding. Not wanting to keep the focus on himself, he searched for a new conversation topic. Finally, he spoke, “I’m late to asking, but how did your squad fare in the battle? I notice you all came back, but what was your role?”

Marrow, packing his pipe with tobacco, answered, “We were deployed as reserves, second from the vanguard. Most of the blood was shed from the front lines, and by the time the reserves pushed through, the Bedrock folk had speared the enemy from the rear. For us, it was less a battle and more an effort of chasing down fleeing scum.”

“That’s a lucky thing, then, to avoid bloodshed,” Sycamore said.

“Lucky? We hardly made ourselves useful,” Lupin said, kicking a groove in the dirt with the toe of his boot.

“Yes, but none came back wounded or worse. Is that not something to be happy about?”

“I did not come to war to chase cowards around.”

“And why did you come?” Sycamore asked, an edge coming to his voice, “To kill?”

“The reason I came,” Lupin said, frowning in irritation, “same as you, to rescue my family, our clan. That some Fireglass scum should die along the way is not something I concern myself with.”

“Are we to be happy, then, when our enemies die?” Sycamore clenched his hands on his trousers to cover their shaking.

“Is this about Mastiff?” Lupin said in disbelief, “Is that why you seem so shaken from the battle? I don’t understand why you grieve him so.”

Pike frowned in recognition, “Mastiff? What’s he talking about, Sprout?” It seemed Lupin had not shared the fate of the one-time bandit.

Sycamore ignored Pike, pushing on, “Answer my question, Lupin. Should I be happy at his death?”

Lupin scowled, biting off an angry response, “I don’t know, Sycamore. I cannot say whether you should feel glad or not. I do know, however, that there is no use in grief. He was a scoundrel, and he beat both me and you half to death. The way I see it, if his death was in place of some other soldier more deserving of life, all the better.”

“And how is he different from you, Lupin? You were my enemy once, and I owe you more bruises than Mastiff ever gave me.” He poked at the scar on his nose, recalling Lupin with his sword. 

“Do not compare me to that scum, Sycamore. Our boyhood feuds are nothing like his banditry,” Lupin said darkly, his face flush with anger, “I thought we were well past that, but perhaps you’re too blinded by half-witted sentiment to see.”

“Enough, both of you!” Pike shouted, “Lupin, you know he speaks to indict not you but himself. And Sprout, take a moment to take stock of what happened. Some died, yes, but that’s an inevitability on the battlefield. Mastiff was a bandit, but you tried to heal him. That he died is reality, but no fault of yours. You may see it as a failure, but to me it speaks to your strength that you feel so affected. Look around you. Many here only still breathe because of your healing. Is that not enough?”

“I could have done more,” Sycamore said, his voice shaking, “I stopped for selfish reasons, to save energy for my own purpose.”

“Your own purpose?” Lupin said with a bark of shocked laughter, “It is not your purpose you stopped for, Sycamore, but our clan’s. What would we have done, had you drained yourself, moved on without our only Speaker, our only healer? We need you, Sycamore. The men and women here volunteered to join the army, they knew the risks.”

“They’re right, boy,” Granite said, “War brings death. To expect otherwise is naiveté. I do not know this Mastiff, nor do I understand why you grieve him so, if he is such a villain. But even now I sit in as much awe of your healing as when you saved Perch’s life.” The woman, seated next to him, nodded emphatically.

“Your mother would be proud, Sycamore, that you care so much,” Juniper added. 

Sycamore’s face twisted in a sneer at the mention of his mother. “My mother would have healed Mastiff and any other who needed it,” He snapped, “Why do you think it grates me so, my own weakness?”

“Aunt Poppy is just one woman, even she could not do the impossible,” Pike said.

Sycamore turned to his friend. “Do you truly believe she would have stopped before there were no injuries left to heal? Would she have let anything distract her from the people dying around her?” He glared at his friend, daring him to respond. Pike worked his jaw but finally broke eye contact. He knew Sycamore was right.

“It’s an insurmountable mountain, to heal all who suffer on a battlefield. A fool’s errand,” Marrow said, blowing a cloud of smoke from his nose.

“My mother would have made every effort to do so,” Sycamore replied with a scowl.

“Then she is a fool,” Marrow said, raising a hand to cut off Sycamore’s reply. “There’s certainly a nobility to such thoughts, but there is only so much one woman can do. Pike has it right for your limitations, and Lupin, for all his spite, understands that you must have priorities. I suspect you would realize this as well, if you would take a moment to think of your mother not as an ideal for your pursuit, but as a person with limits and faults.”

Sycamore swallowed his response, forcing himself to consider the wisdom in the old man’s words. He had not forgotten the purpose of their joining the army, he could not. Despite that, though, he felt the guilt of watching the suffering die around him, the guilt of Mastiff’s death, as a stone sitting heavily in the pit of his stomach. He could not erase that guilt, though they were right about one thing. His goal now was to save their clan. And if that meant he would have to bear his guilt silently, so be it. Perhaps, when they were free and he saw his mother again, he could ask her about her own experiences with war. She had many, he knew, and he could always trust her guidance. 

He took a deep breath, suppressing and exhaling as much of the guilt as he could muster. Some remained, of course, like a lingering scar on the back of his mind, but it was enough for now. He looked from Marrow to Pike and Lupin. There was a mixture of emotions on their face, concern and frustration and confusion and annoyance. All for him. They did not understand why this drove him to madness, could not understand without his abilities and upbringing. It would not do to resent them for it.

He sighed, rubbing at tired eyes. “I apologize, Lupin. To compare you to Mastiff was a step too far. And everyone, please forgive my temper,” He said with a frown, feeling suddenly ashamed to have projected his insecurities, “I just realized that I have not eaten since yesterday morning, and my mother always said I get grumpy when I’m hungry.”

Two days after the Battle of Mistfield, the Whitebrook army finally set out from the remnants of the village. The way the soldiers spoke of the fight was for it to be the first stanza on the epic of their glorious campaign. For Sycamore and the other Heartwood folk, it would also be the last.

A day and a half to the north, they came to a crossroads. The Whitebrook army would head to the northeast, continuing their campaign to force the Fireglass back. The Heartwood would take the other path, straight to the west, following a bit of intelligence that suggested their clan was housed in a prison camp two days away. It was a march to an uncertain end, to the result of their efforts since the ransacking of their village.

After a short farewell to Sister Quartz, Sycamore made his way to the others. He had worried that she would protest him leaving, but apparently she’d expected as much since his enlistment. She relieved him of his duty and wished him luck. It was a comfort to be free of the Speaker Corps, a comfort to feel the reliable weight of a pack on his shoulder. His position as an officer meant he had little to carry on the march – it was all handled by attendants of stuffed into the supply train. He had missed the burden of his pack that had grown so familiar since they set out from their ravaged village.

He found the others loosely gathered at the crossroads. The road split into two directions around a hill: the army walked in a slow procession to the right, Sycamore and the others stood off to the left. Many of the passing soldiers watched them with mild curiosity, but with the daze of the march and the heat of the day, most did not have enough energy to care. When he came to the group, Sycamore was confused to see a pair of unexpected faces. Perch and Granite, each with a pack of their own, seemed set to join them on their trek. When Sycamore asked after their reasons for joining, Granite shrugged an explanation.

“Marrow’s orders,” he mumbled, “I know these lands better than most, and I’m to guide you. Help your clan get back to the city, too, if anything happens.” Perch smacked him on the shoulder and he grimaced, “I also still owe you all for that business of leading you into danger, as Perch has incessantly reminded me. I figured, what better way to make up for it than let you lead me into danger?”

Perch glared at Granite before turning to Sycamore with a smile, “I come much less reluctantly. I owe you my life, it’s the least I can do to put it on the line for you.”

“You don’t have to-”

“Stop,” She said, cutting him off, “I know I don’t have to, but I want to. You’re good people, the Heartwood clan. I suspect any I’ve met so far would put their life on the line if I asked. Add that to my debt, and the decision becomes easy.”

Sycamore frowned, turning to Pike, Lupin, and Juniper. “Did you know about this?”

“Marrow sprung it on us at lunch,” Pike said, “He said he would have told us earlier, but he had to get approval from above.” He glanced at Juniper, “It helps, it seems, when one of your travelling companions is the general’s niece.”

“My aunt is more than a little protective,” Juniper said with a fond smile. 

“Mention the rain and clouds will form,” Lupin muttered, looking over Sycamore’s shoulder towards the army. Sycamore turned to see Lady Marigold approaching with a wide smile on her face, dragging a mule-led cart behind her.

“Heartwood clan,” She said, offering a salute that they returned, “I’ve come to see you off.”

They called out thanks, and Pike spoke the question on their minds, “What’s that you’ve got with you?”

Sycamore looked to the mule-drawn cart and saw the glint of steel.

“A gift,” She said, “From a lieutenant who thanks Sycamore for healing his leg.” She leveled him with a look, and Sycamore frowned.

The others approached the cart eagerly, and Lupin pulled out a spear with wide eyes.

“It’s full of weapons,” He said.

Sycamore sighed, “I’m grateful for the gesture, but you should know that I ask for no payment for my healing, it wouldn’t be right.”

“This is a gift, and a gift is given out of kindness, not obligation,” Lady Marigold said warmly, “Besides, I believe you’ll find it much easier to stage a prisoners’ revolt if you have weapons to arm them with.” Sycamore swallowed. He hadn’t considered that.

“She’s right, Sprout, Pa always says that gifts are best received graciously, and that turning away a gift is for the cynical and ungrateful,” Pike said.

“If Pike’s Pa said it, it’s as good as true. We can’t possibly ask her to take it back, not when so much Fireglass blood is waiting to be spilled,” Lupin added with a smirk. He was studying the weapons, picking up each and examining it for its craftsmanship. Sycamore was sure the blacksmith in him was overjoyed to see so much steel.

Lady Marigold laughed, “I would not take it back if you begged me.” She turned to Juniper, “come here, and give your aunt a hug.” The girl approached in quick steps, and they wrapped each tightly. “I won’t tell you to be careful, as I know you need no such advice,” she said softly, pulling away to look Juniper in the eyes, “instead I’ll tell you to be strong. Your clan needs your strength, the strength your father taught you. Make us proud out there. Teach the Fireglass the consequences for attacking the Heartwood clan, for attacking my niece.”

“Of course, auntie,” Juniper said, “We’ll teach them out west, and you teach them to the east.” They leaned in for another hug, and Lady Marigold whispered a final comment to Juniper, too soft for Sycamore to hear. Juniper pulled away with teary eyes and a nod, and Lady Marigold turned to Sycamore.

“A word, please, Sycamore,” She said. He blinked in surprise. He did not know what she would want with him. He glanced at Juniper, and she shrugged fractionally. Following behind Lady Marigold, he wandered a bit away from the others. Juniper looked after them with concerned eyes, but was soon distracted as the rest fussed over the mule and its cart of weapons.

When they were a distance from the rest of the Heartwood, Sycamore spoke, “If you’re to ask me to look after Juniper, don’t bother. Your wife did so before I left Whitebrook, and I would even if she hadn’t.” He did not know what other reason she would ask to speak to him.

Lady Marigold grinned at him, “I have every bit of faith in my niece, and every trust that you will do your best to bring her back. I have not come to ask you to look after Juniper, but to ask a simple question.” Sycamore blinked, caught quite off guard. “Tell me,” she continued, “How was the battle, from your perspective?”

“A resounding victory,” Sycamore said with confusion, “your aggressive tactics paid off, and the men and women have nothing but praise for you.” The purpose of the question eluded him.

“I did not ask you to blow wind up my dress,” She said dryly, “but to tell me about the battle as you saw it.”

Sycamore hesitated, but when he looked at Lady Marigold, he saw only curiosity in her eyes. “There was a man,” He finally said, “named Mastiff.”

She raised an eyebrow, “I recall your story from the shanties, and how he sent you to us colorful with bruises. I assume you bring him up with a reason.”

Sycamore nodded slowly, “He was a soldier in this army, took a wound to the leg. From the look of things, he got stepped on more than once before they pulled him out. He died after the battle, because I failed to heal him.” She waited for more, but he shrugged, nothing else to add.

She stared at him for a long moment before replying, “How old are you again, Sycamore?”

Sycamore paused, feeling a dull shock when he realized his birthday had passed in the previous weeks. “Fourteen.” 

She squeezed her eyes shut, releasing a tired sigh. “So young,” She said softly, “Barely a man by even the most generous of measurements. And with so much talent, so many burdens.” A moment later, her eyes opened, and Sycamore thought he saw pity in the way she looked at him.

“I wish I could order you to stay with the army,” She continued, “They give medals for what you did; we charged into that battle with the wind roaring at our back, and when we limped back bloody and broken, you healed many who would have died. But I know I cannot order you to stay, nor, I imagine, would you accept a medal. Instead I want you to communicate an offer to your mother.” She paused for a moment until Sycamore nodded his understanding, “There’s a bit of empty land to the south of Whitebrook. My father had plans to cultivate it, to expand our vineyards, but he died before he could, and I never carried out his plan. There’s enough land there for a village. I want to offer it to your clan; your village is burned, and you should rebuild it closer to Whitebrook.”

Sycamore’s eyes widened as he considered the offer. He had not even thought of moving the village, had not imagined it would be possible. “What would you ask in return?”

She frowned at the question. “No more than what we ask of any other village. You would pay taxes to Whitebrook, for protection. Today, I cannot give you men because your clan lived in isolation, but if you accept my offer, this would never be an issue again. Besides, it would make my niece happy to have her clan closer to the city.” 

“There must be more to it,” Sycamore demanded, “What motivates you to act with such generosity.”

She smiled lightly, “Consider it a favor for a friend.” Sycamore frowned, but saw no jest in her expression. Finally, he nodded, accepting the explanation.

“Can you give me a moment?” He asked, and she nodded with an amused look.

_What do you think?_ He asked the Magus, feeling the warm Soul Stone under his shirt.

_I suspect what I think has little to do with the matters of your clan. It’s not something an outsider should have a say in._

_Part of the bargain was for your wisdom, remember. And I hardly speak for the Heartwood, either. You’re no longer an outsider, as you’re bound to me._

There was a pause. _Marigold has done nothing to give you reason to distrust her. In fact, she has been uncompromising in her generosity. Even if she has some ulterior motive, I suspect it extends little beyond wanting to form a connection with you or your clan. I think you can take her at her word. Whether it’s the correct decision for your clan is entirely another matter, and I’m not familiar enough with the Heartwood to know._

Sycamore nodded to himself. The Magus spoke rightly about the Heartwood. Even Sycamore could barely guess at how the council would react to such an offer. They had always desired peace and isolation. He looked up to Lady Marigold, “If a war were to occur, would we be compelled to fight?”

She shrugged, “Whitebrook is not a clan known for warmaking; if we fight a war, we do so for just reasons. Men and women usually flock to the banners, and as far as I know we never need to muster troops by force.”

Sycamore swallowed. His mother and the council would not like the burdens of being connected to society. He knew they would wish to return to their peaceful village, rebuild and continue as things were before. But then, the Heartwood clan was more than just his mother and the council, and perhaps other minds would change after being imprisoned by the Fireglass. Isolation had not provided the security and peace they wished for.

“I won’t bring the offer to my mother,” Sycamore said, “But to my brother, the head of our clan. What you offer is a far larger matter than anything I can consider.”

She nodded after a moment, “Of course, that’s all I can ask for. Thank you, Sycamore, for considering my offer honestly.” He moved to leave, but she placed a hand on his shoulder, holding him back, “I have already asked so much of you, but I have one more favor I need. Come back alive. I would be very sad to see your story end so young.” 

Sycamore chuckled lightly. “I dislike expectations and am not fond of goodbyes, but I can agree to that. Thank you.”

With a smile and a nod, she released him. They returned to the other Heartwood folk, and after a few final goodbyes, Lady Marigold returned to her army and the rest set out to save their clan.
