_The boy continued to surprise. While preparing lunch, my companion cut her hand in a moment of carelessness. It was a shallow cut across the palm, where a knife slipped through a piece of fruit more tender than expected. She made to dress the wound with gauze we carried, but the boy approached and asked to see it. He cooed gentle nonsense, and my companion and I shared an amused look. I thought he was, in his youth, emulating how his mother treated his wounds. Then, my companion gasped, tearing her hand from where the boy held it. The cut was gone, healed, as if never there. My companion seemed fine, if shocked, but the boy quickly apologized with a note that he forgot that we were not used to such things. Lunch passed without further incident, but neither my companion nor I looked at the boy with the same eyes._

An excerpt from My History, Memoirs of a Historian

Weariness and distraction pulled at Sycamore’s mind as he walked with Jackdaw and his Mother to the site of the funeral. Three days past, the body of Juniper’s father was found, apparently dead after falling from a tree. Sycamore had helped carry it back. Juniper’s father, a hunter named Loam, had been a large man. By the time they found him, his body had taken to the stiffness of death. Sycamore still ached from the strain of hauling it.

It was customary to wait three days for a funeral. Time enough to gather, to prepare to send off a member of their clan. Sycamore’s clan was small compared to many, unified, and so it felt more like sending off a member of their family.

Sycamore and Jackdaw wore their ceremonial shoulder tunics, dyed in blue to match their mother’s garb, a long length of cloth wrapped to cover shoulders and arms. Sycamore’s hair, agreeable compared to the rest of their clan, was bound in a tight bun on the back of his head. Jackdaw had shorn his hair short for the occasion. Their mother’s hair was done up in complex braids, a rare show of ceremony from the woman. She looked older than Sycamore had ever seen her. Her nights had been spent whispering comforts to Juniper, and she was short of sleep, burdened by worries. The girl, too, walked with them, looking as if a part of her had died with her father. Her face was pallid, splotchy from tears. Sycamore’s mother had put her hair in similar braids, but she picked at them as they walked, undoing them to disarray. Her clothing, too, had lost its organization, but she did not seem to care.

As they approached the pyre, Sycamore spotted Trout and Pike. The twins offered him small smiles, but they were empty. Death was in the air, and there was no joy to be had.

When they hauled the body back from where they found it, Sycamore heard Juniper whimpering denials to his mother. Her father could not have fallen from a tree, he was far too deft. She should have come sooner. Perhaps if she was faster he might still have been living. Sycamore’s mother could only hush her softly.

That first night, Sycamore could not sleep, Juniper’s wails ringing in his ears. His worries over whether he belonged in the tribe and from where he came seemed to dim when put up against the screams of a girl who lost her father. Sycamore’s mother and Juniper spent the night in Jackdaw’s house. The body had been placed on the table which he sat when his mother healed his leg. But, for Loam, there was no healing. Sycamore tried not to look at it as he lay in bed, but found his eyes drifting continually to the mass in the darkness, covered by a cloak.

The next morning, Sycamore was awoken by his mother, enlisted to help examine it, prepare it for cremation. His stomach clenched at the idea, but wordlessly he rose to help. He was driven by a gross sense of curiosity, an odd sense of obligation to the dead man and his daughter. 

-----

It started low, with a lone, reedy voice from the crowd of mourners, like the drone of the wind. A song of mourning, joined slowly by others. Sycamore knew the tune from memory, an old poem, a hymn of loss and longing. Next to him, he heard Jackdaw join in. Sycamore did not have the energy.

The song continued as they reached the pyre, a great mass of wood stacked tall. Atop lay Loam, dressed in similar ceremonial garb to Sycamore and Jackdaw. He lay with his hands clasped on his chest, holding his bow. His head rested upon a quiver of arrows, tipped with bone and fletched with black feathers. Juniper insisted he would have wished to be burned alongside his bow.

Sycamore’s mother had handled most of the grisly business of stitching up the wounds on the body. Her steady, practiced hands made quick work of the cuts and tears. Sycamore helped where he could, choking back disgust and ignoring sounds and sensations he wished not to remember. His mother paused when she came to one wound on the side of his abdomen caked with dried blood. Sycamore brought a cloth to scrub it clean, but she raised a hand, bid him to wait.

“What does this look like to you?” She asked him.

He examined the bloody wound. He had forced his mind to wander, to ignore the brutal work at hand, but with his mother’s question he focused.

“A puncture wound,” Sycamore said, “Perhaps he struck a sharp limb and impaled himself as he tumbled out of the tree?” They presumed from Loam’s broken neck that he had, through some circumstance, fallen from the tree they found him under. 

“Help me here,” She said, and they flipped the body onto its stomach. She gestured to another wound, in a similar spot on the body, also bloody.

Sycamore frowned. “This one looks like something was torn out. And bloody, too. But that would mean something passed through his torso before he died.” His eyes widened in sickening realization. “That could only mean -”

“Fetch your brother,” His mother said in a low, severe voice, “Tell no one of this.”

The singing drew to an end when they reached the Pyre. Friends of Loam congregated around Juniper, offering silent support to the distraught girl. Sycamore’s mother walked in front of the crowd. She paused aside a lit torch, turning to address them. She maintained few of the duties from her time as a priestess, stepping into the role only at times of ceremony. A hush came over the crowd as they waited for her to speak. A hesitant moment passed while she gathered her thoughts. 

“Rare is it for us to gather like this, not in celebration, but in mourning. Rarer still that we do so for one who died such an untimely death,” Her voice was clear in the cool morning air, with the deliberate weight of a eulogy, “Loam was a rock of strength for the village. He came with us, those years ago, joined in our hope for peace and prosperity. He found purpose here, love and family.” Sycamore glanced at Juniper, who did not appear to even be listening. “He served our clan with his silent strength and poise, spending long days and nights hunting to feed us when we were hungry. He was a sure friend, a loving husband and father.”

She grabbed the torch.

“Now his spirit goes north, to drift in the trees of the Songwood where he spent his days, to join his wife Lilac who he loved so dearly, to watch over us and protect us with that same silent strength.”

She approached the pyre, casting the torch on it. The wood, soaked with oil, caught fire quickly. Her voice rose in prayer.

“Borne from the earth, Loam lived off its fruits. Now, to return, he gives back. His blood flows free, to fill the rivers. His last breath, blown to give lift to the wind. And his body, now burned, to bring heat to the world. We live off the heat, the wind, the rivers, and give thanks to loam, that even in death he preserves his people.”

They had found the arrow the night before the funeral. Jackdaw had searched tirelessly, hoping for some explanation to the killing. The shock of the realization festered as a secret in Sycamore’s mind as he watched Juniper in her grief. Loam’s death was no accident. He was killed, shot through with an arrow before tumbling to the ground and snapping his neck. Only Sycamore, his mother, and Jackdaw knew, a secret to be kept until after the funeral. They did not wish to cast a shadow on the ceremony.

The fire burned, hot and loud, and something in Juniper resolved. She cried, her voice hoarse, but it was not in denial or hysteria. There was understanding on her face. Silently, the clan stood, watching as the pyre slowly burned down to ash. Sycamore’s mind was lost in the flames, lost in the idea that someone would kill a member of his clan, lost in Juniper’s tears. But as the flame died down, so, too, did Juniper’s tears. When the last embers cooled, her eyes were dry. Ashes were gathered, placed into an urn presented to Juniper. She would go east, to the city of Whitebrook, where relatives of hers still lived. Many offered to accompany her but she refused, needing the time to reflect and grow.

That evening, a meeting of the council of elders was called, and the tone in the village changed.
