_The boy continued to surprise. While preparing lunch, my companion cut her hand in a moment of carelessness. It was a shallow cut across the palm, where a knife slipped through a piece of fruit more tender than expected. She made to dress the wound with gauze we carried, but the boy approached and asked to see it. He cooed gentle nonsense, and my companion and I shared an amused look. I thought he was, in his youth, emulating how his mother treated his wounds. Then, my companion gasped, tearing her hand from where the boy held it. The cut was gone, healed, as if never there. My companion seemed fine, if shocked, but the boy quickly apologized with a note that he forgot that we were not used to such things. Lunch passed without further incident, but neither my companion nor I looked at the boy with the same eyes._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

----

Weariness and distraction pulled at Sycamore’s mind as he walked with Jackdaw and his Mother to the site of the funeral. Three days past, the body was found, apparently dead after falling from a tree. Sycamore had helped carry it back. Juniper’s father, a hunter named Loam, had been a large man. By the time they found him, his body had taken to the stiffness of death. Sycamore still ached from the strain of hauling it.

It was customary to wait three days for a funeral. Time enough to gather, to prepare to send off a member of their clan. Sycamore’s clan was small compared to many, unified, and so it felt more like sending off a member of their family.

Sycamore and Jackdaw wore their ceremonial shoulder tunics, dyed in blue to match their mother’s garb, a long length of cloth wrapped to cover shoulders and arms. Sycamore’s hair, agreeable compared to that of the rest of their clan, was bound in a tight bun on the back of his head. Jackdaw’s was shorn short for the occasion. Their mother’s was done up in complex braids, a rare show of ceremony from the woman. She looked older than Sycamore had ever seen her. Her nights had been spent whispering comforts to Juniper, and she was short of sleep, burdened by worries. The girl, too, walked with them, looking as if a part of her had died with her father. Her face was pallid, splotchy from tears. Sycamore’s mother had put her hair in similar braids, but she picked at them as they walked, undoing them to disarray. Her clothing, too, had lost its organization, but she did not seem to care.

As they approached the pyre, Sycamore spotted Trout and Pike. The twins offered him small smiles, but they were empty. Death was in the air, and there was no joy to be had. 

----

When they hauled the body back from where they found it, Sycamore heard Juniper whimpering denials to his mother. Her father could not have fallen from a tree, he was far too deft. She should have come sooner. Perhaps if she was faster he might still have been living. Sycamore’s mother could only hush her softly.

That first night, Sycamore could not sleep, Juniper’s wails ringing in his ears. His worries over whether he belonged in the tribe and from where he came seemed to dim when put up against the screams of a girl who lost her father. Sycamore’s mother and Juniper spent the night in Jackdaw’s house. The body had been placed on the table which he sat when his mother healed his leg. But, for Loam, there was no healing. Sycamore tried not to look at it as he lay in bed, but found his eyes drifting continually to the mass in the darkness, covered by a cloak.

The next morning, Sycamore was awoken by his mother, enlisted to help examine it, prepare it for cremation. His stomach clenched at the idea, but wordlessly he rose to help. He was driven by a gross sense of curiosity, an odd feeling of obligation to the dead man and his daughter.

----

It started low, with a lone, reedy voice from the crowd of mourners, like the drone of the wind. A song of mourning, joined slowly by others. Sycamore knew the tune from memory, an old poem, a hymn of loss and longing. Next to him, he heard Jackdaw join in. Sycamore did not have the energy.

The song continued as they reached the pyre, a great pile of wood stacked tall. Atop lay Loam, dressed in similar ceremonial garb to Sycamore and Jackdaw. He lay with his hands clasped on his chest, holding his bow. His head rested upon a quiver of arrows, tipped with bone and fletched with black feathers. Juniper insisted he would have wished to be burned alongside his bow.

----

Sycamore’s mother had handled most of the grisly business of stitching up the wounds on the body. Her steady, practiced hands made quick work of the cuts and tears. Sycamore helped where he could, choking back disgust and trying to ignore sounds and sensations he hoped to quickly forget. His mother paused when she came to one wound on the side of his abdomen caked with dried blood. Sycamore brought a cloth to scrub it clean, but she raised a hand, bid him to wait.

“Tell me, Sapling, if my eyes deceive me. What does this look like to you?” She asked him.

He examined the bloody wound. He had forced his mind to wander, to ignore the brutal work at hand, but with his mother’s question, he focused.

“A puncture wound,” Sycamore said, “Perhaps he struck a sharp limb and impaled himself as he tumbled out of the tree?” They presumed from Loam’s broken neck that he had, through some circumstance, fallen from the tree they found him under. 

“Help me here,” She said, and they flipped the body onto its stomach. She gestured to another wound, in a similar spot on the body, also bloody.

Sycamore frowned. “This one looks like something was torn out. And bloody, too. But that would mean something passed through his torso before he died.” A second of confusion, then his eyes widened in sickening realization. “That could only mean -”

“Fetch your brother,” His mother said in a low, severe voice, “Tell no one of this.”

----

The singing drew to an end when they reached the Pyre. Friends of Loam congregated around Juniper, offering silent support to the distraught girl. Sycamore’s mother walked in front of the crowd. She paused aside a lit torch, turning to address them. Since their migration west, she maintained few of the duties from her time as a priestess, stepping into the role only at times of ceremony. A hush came over the crowd as they waited for her to speak. A hesitant moment passed while she gathered her thoughts. 

“Rare is it for us to gather like this, not in celebration, but in mourning. Rarer still that we do so for one who died such an untimely death,” Her voice was clear in the cool morning air, with the deliberate weight of a eulogy, “Loam was a rock of strength for the village. He came with us, those years ago, joined in our hope for peace and prosperity. He found purpose here, love and family.” Sycamore glanced at Juniper, who did not appear to even be listening. “He served our clan with his quiet strength and poise, spending long days and nights hunting to feed us when we were hungry. He was a sure friend, a loving husband and father.”

She grabbed the torch.

“Now his spirit goes north, to drift in the trees of the Songwood where he spent his days, to join his wife Lilac who he loved so dearly, to watch over us and protect us with that same silent strength.”

She approached the pyre, cast the torch upon it. The wood, soaked with oil, caught fire quickly. Her voice rose in prayer.

“Borne from the earth, Loam lived off its fruits. Now, to return, he gives back. His blood flows free, to fill the rivers. His last breath, blown to give lift to the wind. And his body, now burned, to bring heat to the world. We live in the heat, the wind, the rivers, and give thanks to Loam, that even in death he preserves his people.”

They found the arrow the night before the funeral. Jackdaw had searched tirelessly, hoping for some explanation to the killing. The shock of the realization festered as a secret in Sycamore’s mind as he watched Juniper in her grief. Loam’s death was no accident. He was killed, shot through with an arrow before tumbling to the ground and snapping his neck. Only Sycamore, his mother, and Jackdaw knew, a secret to be kept until after the funeral. They did not wish to cast a shadow on the ceremony.

The fire burned, hot and loud, and something in Juniper resolved. She cried, her voice hoarse, but it was not in denial or hysteria. There was understanding on her face. Silently, the clan stood, watching as the pyre slowly burned down to ash. Sycamore’s mind was lost in the flames, lost in the idea that someone would kill a member of his clan, lost in Juniper’s tears. But as the flame died down, so, too, did Juniper’s tears. When the last embers cooled, her eyes were dry. Ashes were gathered, placed into an urn presented to Juniper. She would go east, to the city of Whitebrook, where relatives of hers still lived. Many offered to accompany her but she refused, needing the time to reflect and grow.

That evening, a meeting of the council of elders was called, and the tone in the village changed.

----

Days passed with no news from the council revealing the truth of Loam’s death. The secret hung like a phantom on Sycamore, and his frustration grew as the time went by. He tried to ask his mother and brother of the council’s plans, but they shook him off, scolded him to silence. It was council business, they said, not his. 

He sought to distract himself from his worries, from the threats of arrows loosed by unknown enemies, but in the wake of the funeral, he found his days remarkably empty. Many of his plans to help around the village, in the forge or in the fields, had been cancelled. And with the ghost of a threat looming over the village, Jackdaw did not have the freedom to organize such for Sycamore. They met, still, for their evening lessons, but aside from that, Jackdaw spent much of his time busy, meeting with the council and scouting in the Songwood to the north.

So Sycamore threw himself into his training, spending his free moments slowly developing his ability to Speak with the Wind. He made slow, consistent progress, and after several days could consistently capture the wind and redirect it. Jackdaw called his progress astounding, a sign of his latent talent. Sycamore knew differently, that his growth was motivated by fear, not talent. Every night he went to sleep fearing he would awake to the sounds of desperate screams, another corpse in the night. He needed strength, he knew, to protect himself, his clan. Eventually his need for knowledge and consultation on his fears drove him back south.

“Welcome back, Sycamore,” The Magus said. Like before, Sycamore had prodded at the essence in the hill and followed the staircase down. He now sat on the floor in the Magus’s library, studying the room while he listened to the Magus speak. “I had hoped you would come back, and I’m glad you’ve proven those hopes well founded.”

Sycamore bit at his lip as the thought of what to say. He was still wary of the Magus, but he no longer believed him a liar. Too much of how he looked, how he was treated could be explained if he was not of the Hillfolk. What’s more, his doubts and anger now seemed to pale with context.

“I don’t trust you, Magus,” Sycamore said, “But I find myself curious and in need of someone with which to speak. So yes, I returned.”

“Of course,” The Magus said, “I’m accustomed to distrust, but know that I will not harm or lie to you within my power. Take this sanctum as my home, and yourself as a guest within it.”

“I will try not to impose on your hospitality,” Sycamore said dryly. He scanned the bookshelves, the altar of marble. There was little that could be considered hospitable about the room.

“A respectful guest,” The magus noted before continuing, “Shall we continue our earlier bargain? An exchanging of questions?”

“I will answer your questions,” Sycamore said, “but more than answers, I come seeking advice.”

“You do not trust me, yet you ask for advice?” 

“To receive advice does not mean I will take it.”

“Fair. Answer my questions, then, and I’ll offer you whatever advice I’m able,” There was a light note of humor to his voice, “Though I make no guarantees on the quality. I am a man of many mistakes.”

Sycamore thought back to the wisdom of Trout and Pike’s pa. “I’ve been told that you will often find a mistake becomes a lesson when all is accounted for.”

“Wise words, though what lessons I have learned, I don’t yet know,” The spirit said, “As memory serves, it’s your turn to speak, as I believe you ran off after my last question.”

A flush of embarrassment at the memory of his reaction passed to Sycamore’s cheeks, but he ignored it. He took a moment to gather his thoughts before speaking.

“There is a threat to my clan from the north. I don’t know what it is, but already it’s killed one of us. I am one of the few people who knows what truly happened to the man, but the others, the adults and leaders of the village, seem slow to react.” When laid out like this, Sycamore realized he did not know much.

The Magus hummed in thought, the sound of it echoing off the walls. Finally he replied, “A large problem for one so young, and right you are to fear such lethargy. Many times have I seen it, a slow reaction to a threat, lingering in indecision until the sword is at your neck. Lessons you spoke of, and this one I know well. Tell me, what advice do you want?”

“I don’t know what to do. I exhaust myself training, but cannot sleep for fear of threats in the night. I wish to understand what is happening, but am told to wait until a decision is reached. I fear to see another pyre, but still who killed my clansman walks free. What course of action should I take?”

“A hefty question with hefty consequence. What do you know of this threat?”

“Little beyond that they killed one of my clansmen.”

“And your clan, what are they called? Do you have any enemies?”

“We’re called the Heartwood clan,” Sycamore said, thinking back to any lessons on his clan’s history and politics, “We came here to escape war, I know, but whether our enemies were any clan in particular, I cannot say. The elder members of our clan do not speak easily of the past, and it’s taboo to ask on such things.”

“War hurts many, even in memory. Another question, then. As you do not have the knowledge of this threat, do you think yourself able to find it and remove it?”

Sycamore thumbed at the sling on his waist, thought of his ability to Speak. Jackdaw told him that many archers and slingers used the ability to lend their projectiles accuracy and speed, to reduce the effects of the wind. He thought, perhaps with practiced, he might be able to catch someone unawares. An image painted itself in his brain of a broken neck, a cold corpse gnawed at by wolves, a bloody abdomen pierced through by an arrow. Nausea swept him, and he dismissed the thought of whether he could kill with his sling.

“Sycamore?” The Magus asked, noticing his slowness to respond.

“No, I doubt I could,” Sycamore said.

“Of course. A final question. Do you trust those in charge yours, the Heartwood clan?” 

“Yes,” Sycamore immediately replied. His brother was the clan’s Head, and his mother on the council. 

“If that’s the case, you have two courses of action, as I see it. The first is, since you are unable to remove and do not know the nature of the threat, to raise a fuss in your village, bring the issue to the forefront, and force a response. Likely this will upset many, and you may suffer as a result, but it also may be the quickest way to assuage your fears and resolve the issue.”

“And the second?” Sycamore asked. He faced enough harsh treatment without making himself a hell raiser.

“To rely on your trust in your leaders to sooth your worries. If your trust is well placed, they will not betray it, and this problem will be solved on their terms.”

Sycamore did not reply. His eyes traced the bookshelves as he thought on the Magus’s words.

“You do not like my advice,” the Magus said.

“I do not like it because it sounds too similar to what my mother would say,” Sycamore said sullenly. He had hoped the Magus might offer some hidden insight, like the fact that he was Westfolk, to clear up his path. 

“Your mother sounds wise.”

“She would say the same,” Sycamore said with a sigh, “Thank you, Magus, for your council. Perhaps I simply needed to hear such advice in a different voice.”

“You owe me no thanks, Sycamore, for it was nothing but a part of our exchange.”

“Then let’s continue. Ask your question.”

A moment of silence passed before the Magus responded. “Questions I have, but first, I have a request and a bargain. The request, a demonstration, here, of your ability to heal. My curiosity has been piqued by your descriptions, and I wonder after what new insight I could gain by observing the use of your abilities.”

Sycamore shook his head. “Unless you are able to pull forth a body for me to use my healing on, I’m afraid that’s impossible. Were I able, I would slice open my hand and heal it in front of you, if only to boast on my ability. But I can do no such thing, as healing yourself is far beyond taboo. It is life threatening.”

“Fascinating, that,” The Magus said, “I still would like a demonstration, but that answer alone raises many new paths of thought.” He drifted into muttering in that foreign language, what Sycamore assumed to be the language of the Westfolk kingdoms.

“And your bargain?” Sycamore said, interrupting the Magus in his muttering. 

“A more formal rendering of our exchange. I confess, Sycamore, that while I consider myself content in isolation, after speaking to you I found the silence began to irk me. Of course, I am delighted by your company, but your descriptions of your family, your village, have brought curiosity,” The Magus said.

Sycamore did not follow where the Magus lead. “Would you have me sign a contract? To swear to answer any questions you have?”

“A contract, in a way, yes, but not to answer questions. Your ability with soul magic, or healing, as you call it, opens for us many opportunities for collaboration. I know of a method to bind our souls in contract. Your body will serve as a lens for my soul, a space for me to observe the world as you walk through it. In exchange I offer training, knowledge. What you see before you in my library is but a part of what I hold in my mind. I can teach you of the history of our people, the Westfolk, as well as the language. I can teach you of soul magic, its strengths and risks. And, if you wish it, I can teach you the magic of our people. You have a bright mind, I feel, and could become a Magus in your own right with my training.”

Sycamore carefully thought over the bargain. Speaking with the Magus was interesting, a different perspective than anyone in his clan. But to bind his essence was a commitment he couldn’t easily make. Renewed doubt flared in his mind, reminding him how little he truly knew about the voice speaking to him. He sat in a room, secluded under a rocky hill, full of books and little else. The Magus said he was a scholar of magic of the Westfolk, and Sycamore took him at his word, but that trust did not extend far beyond common curtesy. He had, after all, mentioned that his tower had been struck down for fear of his knowledge.

Still, there was an allure to the prospect of having one with such knowledge to teach him. And with things as they were, he could use more training, more power.

“What you propose is a significant commitment,” Sycamore said.

“For both of us, you may not realize. What we would do is an equal relationship. The bond could be severed at any time, should one of us act out of the terms. Of course, I do not wish to rush you in the offer. As you said, it’s a substantial commitment, and I would fault you if you made it lightly.”

“A problem I have,” Sycamore said, “Is that while you can assure me that this is an equal relationship, your knowledge of soul magic certainly outstrips mine, and I will be unable to verify that. Difficult to commit myself with such little knowledge.”

“True enough. Difficult it is to read a contract if you do not speak the language,” The Magus replied, “What do you say to an offer of good faith, to convince you of the bargain. I will teach you what you need to know of soul magic to understand how we will bind our souls, and then you may make your decision on the bargain.”

Sycamore thought it over a moment. There was little commitment here besides the Magus teaching him, and Sycamore was nothing if not greedy to learn.

“That sounds reasonable to me, but I can’t promise I will agree to your bargain in the end,” Sycamore said. Even if he had full understanding of it, binding his essence to another felt somehow unnatural to him. 

“I would not fault you if you came to that decision, though I would feel disappointed. Come, then. Take a seat at my desk. Let’s begin your instruction.”
