_His boyish face and open expression suggested he was no more than ten or eleven years old. He wore clothes of linen and hide in a style unfamiliar to me. As far as I knew, there were no remaining villages in these plains. Following the Purging of the Eastern Heresy and the Brush Wars, the people of the Kingdom called this land cursed. I had come to the east expecting ruins and death. Instead, I had found the boy._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

Sycamore’s clan feasted on boar that night. The hunters triumphantly returned just before the setting of the sun. Pike and Trout carried a boar between them, bound to a shaft of wood. It was a large thing, enough to feed much of their clan. The hunt had been more successful than expected. Aside from the boar, they carried with them deer and fowl, to be cured and smoked or preserved in fat and salt. Laughter and song filled the night air. The boar was roasted on a spit and served with a porridge of grain and beans. Casks of wine, fermented over the winter, were brought out in celebration of the New Year and of good fortune on the hunt. 

Sycamore suppressed his jealousy as he healed Pike, who injured his wrist while sticking the hog. Sycamore felt tiny next to his friend, who had grown, along with his twin brother, to be the tallest of all their peers. He had the same sandy brown hair and dark brown eyes as most of their clan. He was smiling, despite his injury.

“You would not have believed it had you been there, Sprout.” A pet name for Sycamore, far kinder than what many of the other children called him. “The bay dogs howled at the hog, sending it running. Call it fortune or the direction of the wind, but it chose to come to me. When it saw me as it rushed out of the bushes, I swear it flew into a fit of rage. Trout said it squealed, but I did not hear it over the thumping of my own heart.”

“You were frightened?” Sycamore asked while prodding his friend’s wrist. It was a simple sprain.

“Of course!” his friend replied brightly, “I think anyone would be. My pa says there’s no shame in fear unless you fall to it.”

“But you didn’t.” Sycamore used his healer’s touch and easily pulled Pike’s essence to the injury. He felt his friend shudder at the connection, and watched closely as the essence moved from his core, healing the sprain. As quickly as it started, the healing was finished.

“Thank you, sprout,” He said, flexing his newly healed wrist. “Truth be told, it was a near thing. The pig-spear shook in my hands and I about wet myself before I steadied my breath and lined up the spear as we’ve been taught.”

“And the boar?” Sycamore asked with excitement.

“Ran itself through with my spear. Almost as if it wanted me to have the glory.”

“Was it heavy? Did it hurt, when it hit the spear?”

“The spear sunk easily into the pig’s neck, but lodged itself against bone. It was a tremendous shock as the weight of it pushed against me. I held on, but just barely. The thing twisted my wrist real good as it thrashed and forced itself further onto the spear shaft. I swear by the wind, I could smell its blood and feel its breath when it finally decided to die.” He shuddered. “I had a moment of shock before I heard the cheers go up around. After that it was all thumps on the back and shouts of congratulations. I wish you could have been there to see it.” Pike smiled proudly.

Sycamore, despite his jealousy, smiled too. “You just wish to have had one more set of eyes to see your proudest moment.”

“Partly. And to heal my wrist, after you thump my back. And to take a turn carrying the pig. They let Trout and I haul the thing into the village, but we passed it around most of the way.”

“I can see why. It’s a hulking thing, will feed more than a hundred tonight,” Sycamore shook his head. “But take note, Pike. You speared a hog on your first hunt. When mine comes around, I’ll kill two.” Pike laughed loudly, and the two rose from the bench where they sat in Sycamore’s home, making to leave.

Pike wrapped an arm around Sycamore’s shoulder as they emerged into the festivities at the village center. His friend grinned down at him, the light of the bonfire reflecting off his eyes. “Come and feast with us. My brother promised to sneak a cask of wine from under our ma’s nose. You’re welcome to share it.” 

Sycamore grinned. He was still jealous of his friend, of course, but he would not let those feelings ruin a chance at festivity. 

-----

Hours later, Sycamore groggily returned home. He had shared the wine with his friends, drinking, making jokes, and telling stories of their younger years. They boasted of past achievements and future success. Thankfully, his mother was still out when he returned, else he would have had to answer her questions about his stumbling. He nearly tripped as he pulled his boots off, steadying himself on a table. His hand came to rest on a rough object. He grabbed the thing and examined it. It was the rock that had pierced his leg that morning. He looked at it closely as he walked to his bed. He had washed it earlier, but in the darkness and through the haze of wine, it almost looked stained with blood. He shuddered, remembering the shock of seeing it in his leg, the pain of limping back to the village. He set the stone down on a stool next to his bed and lay down. He had thought himself tired, but memories of the day had pushed aside his drowsiness. He would go out the next day, find the hare’s carcass, or what was left of it. Carrion eaters would have the meat by then, but perhaps something would remain to use for traps or bone meal. If there was nothing, no matter. He wanted the closure, at least.

The door opened, interrupting his planning, and a pair of people walked in. Sycamore slowed his breathing, emulating sleep. He did not wish to speak to his mother or whomever she had returned with. They spoke in hushed tones.

“Speak softly. Sycamore sleeps,” His mother said.

“Of course,” It was the voice of the clan’s Head, Jackdaw Lenos. “What say you of the men’s concerns? We’ve never had a boar so far south this early in the season, and they are wary.”

“Wary of what, then?” Her tone was sharp. Sycamore knew she did not like discussions of ill fortune.

“Wary that it may be a sign of something. The forest seemed restless, and the men took note. There’s talk among them of change to the north.”

“The Fireglass?” His mother asked.

“There’s been no word from them in years, but our scouts say they see smoke.”

“And what would you have me do, then, Jackdaw? Listen to the wind for sounds of smoke and flame?”

“Give them honest advice. Relieve their fears, or prepare them for what’s to come. They may have voted me Head, but your word holds sway in the council. They trust your wisdom. I do.” There was unease in the Head’s voice, more than Sycamore had ever heard.

“My honest advice,” His mother said, “Is that if you seek omens, you’ll find them plentiful. We can do nothing but as usual. You have good ears, a good head. Listen to the wind, make sound judgements. You say they trust me, my son, but I trust you. It was no mistake to vote you Head. Now go, before you wake your brother.”

Sycamore heard Jackdaw, his elder brother, sigh deeply before replying. “Alright, Mother, I’ll trust your word. Goodnight. Give Sycamore my thanks for the healing he performed on the hunters, though I heard Pike injured himself again falling down drunk.” Sycamore stifled a laugh. The twins had drunk more heavily than he, and it was not surprising one of them had injured themselves.

“You should thank him yourself. You’d do well to speak to him more; he’s no longer the child you see him as.”

Jackdaw grunted noncommittally before wishing his Mother a final good night and leaving their house. He lived separately, had moved out several years before upon becoming an adult.

Sycamore’s mother hummed a light tune as she readied for bed. It was familiar to Sycamore, an old lullaby she used. After a moment, he heard her lay down on the bed across the room. Just as he drifted to sleep, Sycamore heard his mother say, “Two fool boys.”

-----

That night Sycamore dreamed of fire and ruin. A stone spire stood amidst a storm of flame. The walls crumbled and scattered, but the foundation remained. Flashes of children, fleeing in the night. A cold prison of stone and ash. There was something in there, memories and portents of violence and solitude. Sycamore walked among these images with a sense of dread and longing. The plains around him burned, where his village once was, would soon be. Fire from the north, fire from the west. And to the south, a fragment. A hare, drinking from a brook, shrieking in pain. A statue of a man, crumbling to dust. And Sycamore, walking in the hills, searching for something. The shriek of the hare grew louder, and behind it the sound of burning wood, popping and crackling. Sycamore set foot on the tallest hill, and the noise ceased. With a jolt, he awoke breathlessly. Clutched in his hand was the shard of rock, pulled from his leg the previous day. He unknowingly grabbed it while dreaming. He set it down on the stool. There were deep marks in his hand where he had gripped it, and he traced them with his finger, thinking, uneasily, about what he had dreamed.

He told no one of his dreams that morning, unable to describe them adequately. The visions he eventually dismissed, blaming them on his inexperience with wine. The dizziness and queasiness, too, distracted him from dwelling on the dreams. And, with the rising sun, the sense of ill-ease faded. 

Despite the feasting of the previous night, he was deeply hungry; a result of the healing on his leg. He heated some of the remaining porridge and pork over a cooking fire and ate his fill, settling his stomach of the minor pain that came from his hangover. His mother left soon after he awoke, off to gather herbs in the groves to the north. Sycamore nearly asked if she was to listen for smoke, but stopped himself, fearing her reaction to his eavesdropping the night before.

After she left, Sycamore found himself alone with his thoughts and plans for the day. He resolved to head south, find the hare among the rocks. He gathered his sling and set out in search of Trout and Pike. He had spoken to them of the hare the night before, and it had been their idea to find it for some closure, repeating their Pa’s advice: “A failure turns to a lesson when all is accounted for.”

Sycamore made his way towards Pike and Trout’s home, seeking to invite them to accompany him. The twins were Shepherd’s boys and lived on the southern outskirts of the village. There were remnants of the night’s festivities scattered about: discarded empty casks of wine, dogs gnawing on animal bones. He spotted the twins sprawled on the ground under a tree. They looked halfway to death.

“Good morning,” Sycamore called as he approached.

“Is that you sprout?” Trout groaned, “I’m surprised you still live after the fun we got up to last night.”

 “I swear I’ll never touch wine again,” Pike said.

“Unlike you fools, I understand restraint,” Sycamore said, grinning.

“Stop it, you sound like your ma,” Trout whined.

“Even on my wedding, or when I have my first son, or on my deathbed,” Pike said.

“Can you use that healing of yours to fix us? I hardly feel alive, now, surely somethings broken inside me,” Trout pleaded.

Sycamore laughed. “I’m afraid not. Perhaps my mother could do something, but I know little about curing illness. Besides, if I could I’m not sure I would. After all, it was last night you told me that a failure turns to a lesson when all’s accounted for.”

“Curse my pa and his wisdom,” Trout said.

“Henceforth I will only know wine as the drink of death,” Pike said.

“I had expected to find you tending the flock in the fields. What excuses did you make to beg off?”

“After my ma woke us up with a pail of water to the face this morning, she felt pity enough to give us the morning off. She warned us to be ready to do twice the work tomorrow,” Trout said, “Pa just laughed.”

“A man who’s already learned this lesson,” Sycamore said, “More than once, if my guess is right.” Sycamore laughed, and Trout chuckled half-heartedly, but was interrupted by the sound of Pike retching. This only made Sycamore laugh more, bringing muted curses from Pike between gasps.

“Anyway, Sprout,” Trout said, “Why did you come to find us this morning? I assume it wasn’t only to laugh at my brother.”

“No, that was an unexpected delight,” Sycamore said. “I hoped to invite you to accompany me on a trek south. I have unfinished business with a certain hare.”

“Yes, that’s right,” Trout said, “One with a broken leg, the other, stabbed. An epic in the making. Unfortunately you can see my brother and I are occupied.” He slapped Pike on the back as another round of retches started, “But maybe that’s for the best. Some enemies are best defeated alone.”

“I should be off, then,” Sycamore said, “Good luck with the-“

“Is that the runt?” A voice called out. Sycamore winced involuntarily. “And the two woolheads. My favorite trio.”

Sycamore turned to the source of the voice, an approaching youth. He was large for their age, with broad shoulders. He was not quite so tall as Pike and Trout, though he was taller than Sycamore, of course. He wore the same cut of clothing and had the same eyes and hair as the rest of their clan. The only thing that set him apart from the other children in the clan was the sword strapped to his waist, a gift from his father that he carried at all times.

“Lupin,” Trout said. Pike forced himself to sit up enough to glare at the boy. “What do you want?”

“Peace, fishie,” Lupin said with a light smile, “I did not mean to interrupt your brother’s flopping on the ground, but I wish to speak to the runt.”

“And what could you have to say to Sycamore?” Trout demanded.

“Your sprout can speak for himself,” Lupin said, “Unless he’s forgotten how since I last checked. Wouldn’t surprise me that his brain is as weak as his body.”

“What do you want, Lupin?” Sycamore asked.

“Just to ask after your well-being!” Lupin said with feign innocence, “After you threw a fit and stormed off yesterday morning, I was worried you’d be too embarrassed to show your face around the village again. Thankfully, you lack such... reticence. Of course, I can’t imagine such shame happening to anyone but you, runt.” Lupin strode over to Sycamore, placed a hand on his shoulder. “Do not worry. I’m sure, some day, in many years, you’ll be big enough to come with us on the hunt. Perhaps by the time my children are adults.”

Sycamore bit back a barb doubting Lupin’s ability to have children. It would not do to provoke the larger boy. He was bigger than Sycamore, stronger. Lupin was urging Sycamore to fight back, so he could throw him in the dirt. It was a common pattern.

“What’s the matter, Sprout?” Lupin said, “too ashamed to say anything? Or, perhaps, you’re finally starting to understand how little you belong around here.”

“Lupin, step back,” Trout said, an edge to his tone.

“Or what? You’ll step in to save the runt, as usual? Of course, it’s in your blood, isn’t it? The shepherd’s instinct to protect something weak and defenseless.” Sycamore’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment. He wanted to protest that he could fight his own battles, but memories of bruises and scrapes froze him in place, warning him that to protest was to bring pain.

“Come on, Sprout, say something!” Pike said, “Do not let him speak of you like that.”

“But he know’s I’m right,” Lupin said, “Yesterday’s exclusion has finally shown him that what I’ve been saying for years is correct. His presence, for a long time, was funny. His soot-stained hair and tiny, swampy eyes were good for a joke, like a beetle with its legs pulled off. But, like the beetle, we’ve grown tired of seeing the runt struggle. Soon there will be not to do but,” He squeezed Sycamore’s shoulder painfully, “stomp it into the ground.”

Sycamore stared at the ground, unable to respond, unable to move. He heard Trout and Pike rising behind him, coming to save him as usual. It was shameful, and Sycamore wanted nothing more than to leave this place.

“Sycamore, Lupin!” A new voice called out, “What are you getting up to? Not fighting, I hope.” It was Jackdaw.

Immediately Lupin released Sycamores shoulder, turning towards Jackdaw. “Of course not, Head! I was just thanking Sycamore, here, for healing my brother yesterday. Lotus has been singing his praises ever since, and it’s only fitting that I offer my thanks as well.” 

Sycamore glared at Lupin, unbelieving at how easily he lied.

“There’s a good-mannered boy,” Jackdaw said, “Wipe that sour look off your face, Sycamore. I know you don’t always get along with Lupin, but take his words as an offer of goodwill.”

Sycamore heard Trout and Pike beginning to protest behind him, but he did not wish for his brother to see his shame. “Of course. There is no need to thank me, Lupin. I’m simply doing what I ought to as one capable of healing.” There was no sincerity in his voice, he couldn’t muster such feelings. 

“Yes of course, my friend,” Lupin said with a vulpine grin, “And consider my words today as the start of the future.” Sycamore swallowed heavily, the gloom of that statement sinking in.

“Wonderful to see,” Jackdaw said, “Old enemies are just future friends, our mother always says. Speaking of the woman, Sycamore, do you know where she is? I wish to speak to her and the house was empty.” 

“She went north to forage for herbs,” Sycamore said.

“Understood. I’m off to find her, then. Enjoy the day, boys,” He started to turn to leave, but paused , turning back towards Sycamore, “And Sycamore, come find me this evening. I have things to discuss.” With that, Jackdaw turned and left, headed north after their mother.

When he was out of earshot, Lupin spoke again, “I wonder what he desires to speak to you about, runt. Perhaps right now he’s going to inform your mother that you are to be banished from the clan out of shame, and this evening he’ll be throwing you out himself.”

“Enough, Lupin,” Trout called out, “You’ve tormented Sycamore thoroughly already.”

“I’ve heard my mother speaking to yours, you know,” Lupin said, “She says she has two sons, the pride and the shame, the strong and the weak, the Head and the runt.”

Sycamore sharply looked up, “She would never.”

Lupin’s grin widened, “Yes, I heard her myself. She said she wishes Jackdaw was capable of healing, so she could just abandon you.” Sycamore felt anger building next to his shame. He knew his mother would never say such words, but he also knew there was an inkling of truth to them. She had to feel pity, when she saw him next to his brother.

“She says she regrets it, taking you in all those years ago. She said it would have been better to leave you in the ditch with the mud, where you belong.” 

Sycamore lashed out, tackling Lupin to the ground. He threw two, three punches before the larger boy’s shock wore off and his superior strength took over the fight. He pinned Sycamore to the ground, thrashing his face and torso with heavy blows.

“My brother said you were skilled at healing,” Lupin said with a wicked grin, “But let’s put that to the test, shall we?”

He reached for the sword from his belt as Sycamore struggled to free himself. Sycamore froze as Lupin drew the blade, placing the point dangerously close to Sycamore’s eye.

“I’ll prick this eye, here, and we’ll see if you can heal it right back up. If you can’t, it’s no loss. You still have another, and at least I won’t have to see the lifeless swampy green orb anymore.” Sycamore stared at the tip of the blade, dangling above his eye. He had never healed wounds to the eye, and he knew he couldn’t heal himself. He wanted to protest, to scream for Jackdaw to come back and help him, to do anything, but he was paralyzed by the point of the blade growing slowly closer to his eye.

Suddenly Trout was on top of Lupin, knocking the boy off of Sycamore and sending the blade flying. Sycamore felt the tip nick his nose as it was knocked aside, but he hardly noticed. Free to move, Sycamore jumped his feet, dashing away. Behind him, he heard Trout, Pike, and Lupin yelling as they brawled. He hoped his friends would forgive him for fleeing, but he could not be there with them, his shame was too great.
