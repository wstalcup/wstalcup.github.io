_At some point, the boy finally gained the confidence to ask about our histories and reasoning for coming east. I gave him the usual story, a wandering historian eager to explore topics of less well-known history, in this case the kingdoms’ eastern frontiers. My companion shared her past, a career military woman who owed me a few favors. He sighed relief when we described ourselves, explaining that he worried we were some criminals, come this far east to flee justice. We shared a look, at the humor of such a statement. We were criminals fleeing something, yes, but to call it justice was a cruelty._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

The voice broke the silence of their meal.

“Do you mind if we join you for dinner?”

Sycamore was on his feet before he realized it, sword in hand and reaching for the wind. His soup was forgotten, spilled on the ground, covering his boots with chunks of rabbit and yam. The darkness of the road had honed his defensive instinct, and the voice was rough, cold, unknown.

His eyes scanned the darkness, settling on a trio of dark shapes slowly coming towards them. Next to him, Pike and Lupin reacted with similar haste, Lupin with his sword and Pike with his spear. Mrs. Maple had gathered her children protectively behind her, though Hickory whined in protest at the interruption to his dinner. Gramps remained seated, sucking at a tobacco pipe.

“Who are you?” Mrs. Maple called. She clutched a small knife in her hand. It was meant for cooking, but she carried no other weapon with her. Since they passed the first ransacked hamlet, she kept the knife out of her pack.

“Weary travelers,” The center man said. His was the voice from before. “We’ve no food, and have hopes you’d be willing to share yours.” The trio continued to approach their fire, it’s low, flickering light casting their faces in sinister features. The speaker was a roughly built man, nearly as tall as Pike but much sturdier. His hair was pulled behind his head, and he wore thin leather armor over a dirty tunic. There was a woman on his left and a man on his right. They looked to be cut from a similar cloth.

“Is that a request or a demand?” Lupin called out, an edge to his voice. The moody boy was slowly regaining his health, and though he no longer voiced his complaints about their course of action, he still grumbled at their pace.

“You brat! We-” The woman started.

“We have no intentions of harming you,” The center man said, interrupting his companion, “But you must understand, it has been days since we’ve had a proper meal. Anything you could spare would be appreciated.” The man smiled, but the dim light stripped any kindness out of the expression, reducing it to a sneer. Sycamore could not tell if there was a threat in his words, or if it was an earnest request. His caution demanded he maintain his connection to the wind, watch for any sudden movement.

“Forgive my caution,” Mrs. Maple said, her voice a mask of steadiness, “But things as they are, I don’t believe I’m comfortable in sharing a meal with unknown travelers.”

There was an upset grunt from the other man, and that woman started to raise a protest, but the center man raise a hand to cut them off. “I would ask that you reconsider. I understand the circumstances of the road, but hunger robs me of my courtesy.” In that statement, the demand was clear. Sycamore’s eyes darted to the man’s hand, clutched on the hilt of a sheathed sword.

There was a tense moment of pause, an anticipation of violence, but it was interrupted by a harsh cough from Gramps, still seated and smoking. Sycamore looked at the old man. He pointed his pipe at his daughter in an accusing gesture.

“Enough of this,” He said. His voice was a rasp of age and smoke. This was the first time Sycamore had heard him speak at more than a mutter. “Do not let our circumstances rob you of your sense. There’s no need to draw blood over some soup. Plenty for everyone.” He took another puff on his pipe.

“But Gramps-” Mrs. Maple started.

Gramps coughed again, cutting her off. He spoke once his throat was clear. “Did I raise you to draw knives on hungry travelers, girl? Take care, lest cynicism poison your sense.”

“You cannot expect us to trust these folk who come upon us like foxes in the night!” Lupin said in protest. He pointed his sword at the trio, who stood silently watching their argument.

“Gramps is right, Lupin,” Pike said softly, “I think we should let them eat with us.”

“I did not ask for your thoughts, woolhead,” Lupin said, “If a wolf came upon your flock, would you invite it to join you for supper? Do not forget what happened to our village.”

“They took my brother!” Pike snapped, anger suddenly burning in his voice. “You think it possible for me to forget that? Rather, I think you should not forget that you are not the only one whose family was captured by the Fireglass.” He took a short breath, regained his temper. “My Pa always says that the measure of a man is not the kindness he does in the best of times, but the worst of times. Our village is lost, our families are taken, and threats surround us, but food is a small kindness to pay, even now.” Sycamore glanced at his friend. Pike set his spear down and returned to his seat.

“I do not care of your Pa’s dimwitted sayings, we can’t-” Lupin started.

“Enough, Lupin,” Mrs. Maple said, a sigh escaping her lips, “Pike and Gramps are correct in this. If they truly meant us harm, they would not have warned us of their presence by calling out to us.” There was a tiredness to her voice, the mask of calm dropped. She, too, sat back down, turning to the trio, gesturing for them to sit.

“Fine, if you all are so robbed of your wits, they can join us,” Lupin said, his voice falling to a bitter mutter, “But I’ll expect thanks when I’m the only one prepared when they look to rob or kill us later.”

The trio drew nearer, and Sycamore released his hold of the wind, frowning at his upturned bowl of soup as he sat back down. In the light of their fire, they looked far less intimidating. They were ragged from travel, their clothes dirty and faces scruffy. Beyond that, there was a hollowness to their cheeks and weary bags under their eyes that spoke of the struggles of their circumstance. One of the men, considerably older than his two companions, froze when he got a good look at Sycamore, glaring at him with a sour expression. Sycamore quickly broke eye contact, unsure why the man paid him such attention.

Mrs. Maple spoke when they had taken up a weary rest around the fire. “I apologize for our rudeness. This has been a... trying set of days for us.” She filled her bowl with the soup, passing it around to one of the newcomers. Sycamore, his bowl now empty, offered his as well, and with Pike’s, all three soon had food in front of them.

After a frantic moment of slurping down the soup, the center man spoke, “I gathered as much listening to the boys’ words. There’s no need for apology, we came to you in darkness and looking like bandits, so I think your caution was well placed.” He handed the bowl to Mrs. Maple with a grateful nod, and she refilled it and handed it back. “The name’s Granite,” He said, “And my fellows are Marrow and Perch.” He gestured to the two other men before returning to his soup. The older man, Marrow, still glared at Sycamore, even as he ate his soup. Sycamore swallowed, trying to avoid looking at the man but feeling uncomfortable in his attention.

“So what led you to be so starved on the West Road?” Pike asked. With the tension of his argument with Lupin passed, he had returned to his pleasant self, and he offered a friendly smile to the newcomers as they worked through their soup.

Granite shared a look with his companions before speaking. “Our business is our own, young one. Much like I’d not ask you to give a full accounting of what led you lot to brandish weapons at the sound of a stranger’s voice, we’d like to keep our tale private.”

Pike nodded respectfully, but continued his effort at a conversation, “Could you at least tell us in which direction you’re headed? The more travel companions we have, the safer I’d feel.”

“Enough, Pike,” Gramps said, “These men asked for food, not conversation. If they wish to speak of such things, they’ll offer it up themselves. Let them eat in peace.”

“No, no,” Granite said, “I’d be remiss if I couldn’t answer that much. Besides, young Pike speaks wisdom. The roads as they are, comrades hold more value than gold.” He took a sip of soup, now on his third bowl, before continuing. “We’re bound for Whitebrook. Whereabouts are you headed?”

“Whitebrook as well,” Mrs. Maple said. “Though the more I see, the less sure I am that they will make time for us.”

“And what of the Westfolk boy?” Perch asked. She was the youngest of the trio, about Jackdaw’s age. “How did you come upon him? Is he, like us, another traveler? You should be careful with his type, they’re prone to tricks, even if he can’t speak our tongue.”

Sycamore, who was only half-paying attention to the conversation as he studiously ignored Marrow’s incessant glare, belatedly realized that he had not yet spoken a word since the men had come upon them.

“Ah, no, I speak Hillfolk,” He cut in with an awkward tone, “In fact, we’re from the same clan.”

Marrow bit off a muttered curse when Sycamore started to speak, and Walleye gave him an incredulous look. Granite, for his measure, was too distracted by his soup to give more than a mildly interested glance.

“I – I see,” Perch said. She turned back to Mrs. Maple, “Does your clan have many Westfolk in it?” There was skepticism on her face, suspicion.

Mrs. Maple laughed lightly at her tone, “Sycamore is no more Westfolk than you or I. I’ve known him since he was just a babe, and he was present when this one was born.” She patted at Mist’s head as the girl played with a discarded spoon, shaking it around in one hand.

“Well, then,” Perch said, giving Sycamore a narrow eyed look, “Tell me, boy, does your father look like you too? And your mother?”

Sycamore paused for a moment, unsure how to reply. Of course, his mother was Poppy, but maybe Perch meant his birth parents. But he’d never met them, so what was he to say? Thankfully, Granite spared him the awkwardness of trying to answer the question.

“Do not harangue the boy, Perch. The lady here said he’s a member of their clan. So be it, unless you want to give them a full accounting of your life.” He gave his younger companion a cautioning look before turning to Marrow, “And stop giving him those death eyes, man. He’s just a boy; you’ve no grudge against him.” The old man grunted, finally breaking off his glare from Sycamore, turning his angry eyes down to his bowl of soup.

Perch looked about to protest for a moment, but decided against it, offering a reluctant nod. “Apologies, boy. I was simply curious. I’ve not seen more than a handful of Westfolk, you see, and they all were merchants or wanderers. What I’ve heard of them has left me,” her eyes flicked to Marrow and back to Sycamore, “unsure.”

Sycamore forced an awkward chuckle. It still hardly occurred to him that he was not of the Hillfolk, no matter what the Magus had told him. Confronted with such here left him feeling uncomfortable and put on the spot.

“He’s no merchant or wanderer, but a member of our clan. Nothing unsure there,” Lupin said sourly, “You’d do well to remember it.” Sycamore was surprised to hear the other boy defend him, but still gave Lupin a grateful nod.

Perch looked from Lupin to Sycamore before responding. “Of course, I meant no rudeness.” She turned back to his soup, and the camp drifted to the silence of unfamiliar companionship.

The mundanity of travel quickly overcame unfamiliarity and awkwardness. In fact, nearly anything aside the steady movement of feet and dull aches of the road faded to the background. There was little to talk of through the tired effort of keeping a steady pace. Burdens of memory and dread weighed heavily, forestalling any desire for conversation. 

Three days on the road and nearly a week distant from the raid on the village, and Sycamore finally began to put the state of things in order. Their plan upon leaving the protection of the Magus’s sanctum was simple enough: appeal for council and aid in Whitebrook and rescue the Heartwood clan, wherever they may be imprisoned. Fear lingered in his mind, though, that they would be helpless to do anything. They’d set out with naïve hopes that they might rally an army to free their families and restore normalcy, but the more he saw of the road the less those hopes seemed realistic. The West Road was all but deserted; they’d seen no travelers apart from Granite and his group. Most buildings they passed bore the scars of fire and raiding, and those that didn’t were deserted, with boarded-over doors and windows.

The grim state of things began to reflect on their moods. Lupin’s complaints dulled as he realized the scope of the destruction. Pike’s good nature was undercut with tension, his smiles forced. Even Mrs. Maple, who had been a constant source of quiet determination, began to suffer the effects of stress and tension. Hope drained from them slowly, like water from a rusted bucket. 

The bright side of things was that, with Granite, Marrow, and Perch, the burdens of life on the road lessened. More able hands meant less work, and though the trio proved weak at hunting and foraging, they followed instructions ably and worked efficiently. 

“It was the Fireglass, then...” Perch muttered as she and Sycamore gathered kindling in a roadside copse.

“They rounded up nearly every one of our clan and dragged them off somewhere. Those of us who got away hid for a few days before setting out east,” Sycamore said, finishing his tale of the raid on the village. Perch seemed the most interested in conversation of the three, curious where Granite was preoccupied with his own worries. That was to say nothing of Marrow, who spent half his time walking staring daggers at the back of Sycamore’s head.

She grabbed a stick off the ground, adding it to her bundle. She’d volunteered to help Sycamore gather the wood, and he’d easily accepted. It wasn’t a difficult chore, but gathering enough sticks to burn for the night and breaking them to a reasonable size was time consuming.

“What’s your story then?” Sycamore asked before recalling Granite’s hesitation at explaining from the night before, “That is, if you don’t mind sharing.”

She chuckled lightly. “No, it’s fine. Granite’s spent a lot of time travelling, and harsh experiences have made him slow to trust, but you seem to be nice enough folk.” She grabbed another stick, snapping it in half with her foot before adding it to her armful.

“We were travelling with a caravan of merchants when some raiders in dark armor – the Fireglass, you say – came upon us and rounded up our goods and men,” 

“You were merchants?” Sycamore asked, curiosity piqued. Merchants were rare in the Heartwood village. Remote as it was, they were mostly self-sufficient.

She paused, gnawing on a lip for a moment before continuing, “Not merchants ourselves, just travelling with merchants. Granite, Marrow, and I were – lucky enough to get away.” There was a pause there, some detail she didn’t want to reveal, but Sycamore had hardly told her all the details of his story, so he would not press. “It was a rough time getting away, and we feared pursuit, so we fled down the road back towards Whitebrook. Days later, we happened upon you. It’s a lucky thing, too. I’m not sure how much further we could have gone without a meal.” 

Sycamore grunted understanding, not knowing how to respond. Her expression had clouded with distraction, memories of the harshness of reality. Sycamore understood. Recounting what the raid on the village brought him back to uncomfortable places, with the smell of ash and blood, the look of a man, dead by his hand. They finished their chore in silence.

In the evening, after a meal of wild greens and trail bread, they sat around their cook fire, leisurely passing the time. With more bodies to do chores, things were done quickly, leaving them with more free time. Sycamore practiced his Speaking, guiding the wind in careful patterns through the trees, plucking leaves and sending them in loops as they fell to the ground. He was unsure whether to keep his Speaking a secret. It was taboo to talk of it among his clan, but whether that was because of their prejudice against warfare or a broader Hillfolk tradition, he did not know.

While he silently practiced Speaking, Pike played with the children, giving Mrs. Maple a much-needed break, and Lupin fussed over his sword. It was a daily routine for him to pull the blade out, test its edge, find some smudge to polish out. He hardly used the weapon, but Sycamore respected that it was an important item for him, much like the sling Sycamore’s mother had given him.

After finishing his meal, Marrow strode over to Lupin and spoke to him in a gruff voice, “You know how to use that thing, son?” 

Lupin glared up at him. “Don’t call me son!” He snapped, sliding the sword back into its sheath, “And I understand well enough: stab and slash them until they stop moving. Simple.”

Marrow let out a bark of laughter, “Spoken like a true novice. To stab someone with a sword is perhaps simple enough, but to properly wield one, it’s the difference between piss and ale.”	
Lupin flushed at the jab. “I take it you’re familiar with drinking both, then?” He said with a smirk.

Marrow sneered at him, “They say the hound with the loudest bark has the dullest fang, and I see that to be true.”

“Is it a brawl you want?” Lupin said, rising to his feet. He jerked his head towards Pike, “The woolhead’s Pa would tell me to respect my elders, but I doubt that extends to mouthy old foxes.”

Marrow threw his head back, letting out a roar of laughter. He regained his composure after a moment, smiling a yellow grin at Lupin. “I like you, son. Grab that sword of yours and I’ll show you how to use it, so the next time an old dog runs his mouth, you can show him how sharp your fangs are.”

“That’s a rare offer,” Granite called from where he sat smoking with Gramps, “Marrow’s been teaching young soldiers since before you were born, lad.”

Lupin glared at Granite. “That proves nothing beyond that he’s old. And if I wanted lessons on how to be elderly, I’d ask your smoking buddy.”

“I’d say it’s a good idea,” Pike said, “you remember the last time you tried to use your sword in a fight.” Lupin spun his glare to point at Pike, but there was hesitance on his face. Sycamore remembered it too, skewered in the stomach on the floor of the blacksmith.

“Fine,” Lupin finally said, “A lesson. But if you waste my time, you can expect this dog to do a bit more than bark.”

“Yes, yes, whatever you say. Don’t waste all your energy on quips, you’ve got a sword to be swinging,” Marrow said. He stood up from his seat, made to find somewhere to practice with Lupin.

Sycamore glanced at his own sword, taken off the corpse of the first Fireglass he’d encountered. He wondered if he should ask Marrow to instruct him too. If the past few days were any indicator, he’d find himself using the weapon often. But recalling the way Marrow looked at him and how Lupin was hardly his choice of practice partner, he decided to hold his tongue.

“Sprout!” Pike called out to him, “we should probably also get in some practice. Grab your sling, and I’ll wager tomorrow’s chores that my aim’s the better of us.”

“I didn’t realize you so wished to double your workload,” Sycamore said with a grin. He jumped to his feet, releasing his connection to the wind and undoing the sling tied at his waist. The last time he’d properly used it was when he struck that raider in the village, and it wouldn’t do for him to let his skills rust.

“Do you mind if I get in on your wager?” Perch said, pulling a black leather cord out of her pack.

“Only if you swear not to back out after I cast my first stone,” Pike said with a smirk.

“Careful there, Pike,” Sycamore said, “Your Ma has warned you about cockiness enough that you should know you’re inviting embarrassment.”

“Bah. Trout’s the cocky one. In me, It’s called confidence.”

Sycamore shook his head, and the trio set off at a trot, looking for some targets to hit, scooping stones up along the way.
