_At some point, the boy finally gained the confidence to ask about our histories and reasoning for coming east. I gave him the usual story, a wandering historian eager to explore topics of less well-known history, in this case the kingdoms’ eastern frontiers. My companion shared her past, a career military woman who owed me a few favors. He sighed relief when we described ourselves, explaining that he worried we were some criminals, come this far east to flee justice. We shared a look, at the humor of such a statement. We were criminals fleeing something, yes, but to call it justice was a cruelty._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

The voice broke the silence of their meal.

“Do you mind if we join you for dinner?”

Sycamore was on his feet before he realized it, sword in hand and reaching for the wind. His soup was forgotten, spilled on the ground, covering his boots with chunks of rabbit and yam. The darkness of the road had honed his defensive instinct, and the voice was rough, cold, unknown.

His eyes scanned the darkness, settling on a trio of dark shapes slowly coming towards them. Next to him, Pike and Lupin reacted with similar haste, Lupin with his sword and Pike with his spear. Mrs. Maple had gathered her children protectively behind her, though Hickory whined in protest at the interruption to his dinner. Gramps remained seated, sucking at a tobacco pipe.

“Who are you?” Mrs. Maple called. She clutched a small knife in her hand. It was meant for cooking, but she carried no other weapon with her. Since they passed the first ransacked hamlet, she kept the knife out of her pack.

“Weary travelers,” The center man said. His was the voice from before. “We’ve no food, and have hopes you’d be willing to share yours.” The trio continued to approach their fire, it’s low, flickering light casting their faces in sinister features. The speaker was a roughly built man, nearly as tall as Pike but much sturdier. His hair was pulled behind his head, and he wore thin leather armor over a dirty tunic. The men flanking him looked cut from the same cloth.

“Is that a request or a demand?” Lupin called out, an edge to his voice. The moody boy was slowly regaining his health, and though he no longer voiced his complaints about their course of action, he still grumbled at their pace.

“You brat! We-” A new, younger voice started.

“We have no intentions of harming you,” The center man said, interrupting his companion, “But you must understand, it has been days since we’ve had a proper meal. Anything you could spare would be appreciated.” The man smiled, but the dim light stripped any kindness out of the expression, reducing it to a sneer. Sycamore could not tell if there was a threat in his words, or if it was an earnest request. His caution demanded he maintain his connection to the wind, watch for any sudden movement.

“Forgive my caution,” Mrs. Maple said, her voice a mask of steadiness, “But things as they are, I don’t believe I’m comfortable in sharing a meal with unknown travelers.”

There was an upset grunt from one of the men, and that second voice started to raise a protest, but the center man raise a hand to cut him off. “I would ask that you reconsider. I understand the circumstances of the road, but hunger robs me of my courtesy.” In that statement, the demand was clear. Sycamore’s eyes darted to the man’s hand, clutched on the hilt of a sheathed sword.

There was a tense moment of pause, an anticipation of violence, but it was interrupted by a harsh cough from Gramps, still seated and smoking. Sycamore looked at the old man. He pointed his pipe at his daughter in an accusing gesture.

“Enough of this,” He said. His voice was a rasp of age and smoke. This was the first time Sycamore had heard him speak at more than a mutter. “Do not let our circumstances rob you of your sense. There’s no need to draw blood over some soup. Plenty for everyone.” He took another puff on his pipe.

“But Gramps-” Mrs. Maple started.

Gramps coughed again, cutting her off. He spoke once his throat was clear. “Did I raise you to draw knives on hungry travelers, girl? Take care, lest cynicism poison your sense.” 

“You cannot expect us to trust these fellows who come upon us like foxes in the night!” Lupin said in protest. He pointed his sword at the trio, who stood silently watching their argument.

“Gramps is right, Lupin,” Pike said softly, “I think we should let them eat with us.” 

“I did not ask for your thoughts, woolhead,” Lupin said, “If a wolf came upon your flock, would you invite it to join you for supper? Do not forget what happened to our village.”

“They took my brother!” Pike snapped, anger suddenly dripping from his voice. “You think it possible for me to forget that? Rather, I think you should not forget that you are not the only one whose family was captured by the Fireglass.” He took a short breath, regained his temper. “My Pa always says that the measure of a man is not the kindness he does in the best of times, but the worst of times. Our village is lost, our families are taken, and threats surround us, but food is a small kindness to pay, even now.” Sycamore glanced at his friend. Pike set his spear down and returned to his seat.

“I do not care of your Pa’s dimwitted sayings, we can’t-” Lupin started.

“Enough, Lupin,” Mrs. Maple said, a sigh escaping her lips, “Pike and Gramps are correct in this. If they truly meant us harm, they would not have warned us of their presence by calling out to us.” There was a tiredness to her voice, the mask of calm dropped. She, too, sat back down, turning to the trio of men, gesturing for them to sit. 

“Fine, if you all are so robbed of your wits, they can join us,” Lupin said, his voice falling to a bitter mutter, “But I’ll expect thanks when I’m the only one prepared when they look to rob or kill us later.”

The trio of men drew nearer, and Sycamore released his hold of the wind, frowning at his upturned bowl of soup as he sat back down. In the light of their fire, the men looked far less intimidating. They were ragged from travel, their clothes dirty and faces scruffy. Beyond that, there was a hollowness to their cheeks and weary bags under their eyes that spoke of the struggles of their circumstance. One of the men, considerably older than the other two, froze when he got a good look at Sycamore, glaring at him with a sour expression. Sycamore quickly broke eye contact, unsure why the man paid him such attention.

Mrs. Maple spoke when they had taken up weary rest around the fire. “I apologize for our rudeness. This has been a... trying set of days for us.” She filled her bowl with the soup, passing it around to one of the men. Sycamore, his bowl now empty, offered his as well, and with Pike’s, all three men soon had food in front of them.

After a frantic moment of slurping down the soup, the center man spoke, “I gathered as much listening to the boys’ words. There’s no need for apology, we came to you in darkness and looking like bandits, so I think your caution was well placed.” He handed the bowl to Mrs. Maple with a grateful nod, and she refilled it and handed it back. “The name’s Granite,” He said, “And my fellows are Marrow and Walleye.” He gestured to the two other men before returning to his soup. The older man, Marrow, still glared at Sycamore, even as he ate his soup. Sycamore swallowed, trying to avoid looking at the man but feeling uncomfortable in his attention.

“So what led you to be so starved on the West Road?” Pike asked. With the tension of his argument with Lupin passed, he had returned to his pleasant self, and he offered a friendly smile to the men as they worked through their soup.

Granite shared a look with his companions before speaking. “Our business is our own, young one. Much like I’d not ask you to give a full accounting of what led you lot to brandish weapons at the sound of a stranger’s voice, we’d like to keep our tale private.”

Pike nodded respectfully, but continued his effort at a conversation, “Could you at least tell us in which direction you’re headed? The more travel companions we have, the safer I’d feel.”

“Enough, Pike,” Gramps said, “These men asked for food, not conversation. If they wish to speak of such things, they’ll offer it up themselves. Let them eat in peace.”

“No, no,” Granite said, “I’d be remiss if I couldn’t answer that much. Besides, young Pike speaks wisdom. The roads as they are, comrades hold more value than gold.” He took a sip of soup, now on his third bowl, before continuing. “We’re bound for Whitebrook. Whereabouts are you headed?”

“Whitebrook as well,” Mrs. Maple said. “Though the more I see, the less sure I am that they will make time for us.” 

“And what of the Westfolk boy?” Walleye asked. He was the youngest of the trio, about Jackdaw’s age. “How did you come upon him? Is he, like us, another traveler? You should be careful with his type, they’re prone to tricks, even if he can’t speak our tongue.”

Sycamore, who was only half paying attention to the conversation as he studiously ignored Marrow’s incessant glare, belatedly realized that he had not yet spoken a word since the men had come upon them.

“Ah, no, I can understand,” He cut in with an awkward tone, “In fact, we’re from the same clan.”

Marrow bit off a muttered curse when Sycamore started to speak, and Walleye gave him an incredulous look. Granite, for his measure, was too distracted by his soup to give more than a mildly interested glance.

“I – I see,” Walleye said. He turned back to Mrs. Maple, “Does your clan have many Westfolk in it?” There was skepticism on his face, suspicion.

Mrs. Maple laughed lightly at his tone, “Sycamore is no more Westfolk than you or I. I’ve known him since he was just a babe, and he was present when this one was born.” She patted at Mist’s head as the girl played with a discarded spoon, shaking it around in one hand. 

“Well, then,” Walleye said, giving Sycamore a narrow eyed look, “Tell me, boy, does your father look like you too? And your mother?”

Sycamore paused for a moment, unsure how to reply. Of course, his mother was Poppy, but maybe Walleye meant his birth parents. But he’d never met them, so what was he to say? Thankfully, Granite spared him the awkwardness of trying to answer the question.

“Do not harangue the boy, Walleye. The lady here said he’s a member of their clan. So be it, unless you want to give them a full accounting of your life.” He gave his younger companion a cautioning look before turning to Marrow, “And stop giving him those death eyes, man. He’s just a boy, you’ve no grudge against him.” The old man grunted, finally breaking off his glare from Sycamore, turning his angry eyes down to his bowl of soup.

Walleye looked about to protest for a moment, but decided against it, offering a reluctant nod. “Apologies, boy. I was simply curious. I’ve not seen more than a handful of Westfolk, you see, and they all were merchants or wanderers. What I’ve heard of them has left me,” his eyes flicked to Marrow and back to Sycamore, “unsure.”

Sycamore forced an awkward chuckle. It still hardly occurred to him that he was not of the Hillfolk, no matter what the Magus had told him. Confronted with such here left him feeling uncomfortable and put on the spot.

“He’s no merchant or wanderer, but a member of our clan, nothing unsure there,” Lupin said sourly, “You’d do well to remember it.” Sycamore was surprised to hear the other boy defend him, but still gave Lupin a grateful nod.

Walleye looked from Lupin to Sycamore before responding. “Of course, I meant no rudeness.” He turned back to his soup, and the camp drifted to the silence of unfamiliar companionship.

-----

Unfamiliarity and awkwardness were quickly overcome with the mundanity of travel, as was nearly anything aside the steady movement of feet and dull aches of the road. There was little conversation with their new companions. Burdens of memory and dread weighed heavily on them as they travelled. Three days on the road and nearly a week distant from the raid on the village, and Sycamore finally began to put the state of things in order. Out of necessity, they sought council and aid in Whitebrook, but fear lingered in his mind that they would be helpless to do anything for their clan. They’d set out with naïve hopes that they might rally an army to free their clan, restore normalcy, but the more they saw of the road the less those hopes seemed realistic. The West Road was deserted of all but travelers like them. What buildings they passed that were not burned down were deserted, boarded over doors and windows.

The state of things reflected on their group. Lupin’s complaints dulled as he realized the scope of the destruction. Pike’s good mood was undercut with tension, his smiles forced. Even Mrs. Maple, who had been a constant source of quiet determination, began to suffer the effects of stress and tension. Hope drained from them slowly, like water from a rusted bucket. 

The bright side of things was that, with Granite, Marrow, and Walleye, the burdens of life on the road lessened. More able hands meant less work, and though the trio of men proved weak at hunting and foraging, they followed instructions ably and worked efficiently. They acted peculiar in many ways; they were hesitant to take breaks and always had eyes looking in the distance, but Sycamore took that as general caution and desire to make it to Whitebrook. Frankly speaking, he was similarly eager to be finished with their travels. Lupin continued to distrust them, but the others quickly adjusted to their presence, embracing the quiet security of greater numbers.

As they spread the camp chores among the larger party, their evenings were less busy than before. Lupin and Granite’s group wanted to use the extra time to put more road under their feet, but with the children and Gramps such would be impossible. While they grumbled about threats of the road and making faster time, they accepted it soon enough. After spotting the sword at his waist, Marrow offered to give Lupin a few pointers on using the weapon in a fight. Lupin was reluctant to accept any help from the men, but eventually did so when Pike reminded him how his last two swordfights had gone. Although Sycamore also carried a sword, Marrow made no such offer to him. But he hardly noticed, as he was occupied with practicing his Speaking and sling. Walleye turned out to be an ace with the weapon, so Pike, Sycamore, and he entertained themselves with idle marksmanship competitions. Granite, for his measure, spoke softly with Gramps and helped to tend to the children. He apparently had a daughter of his own, not much older than Hickory.

On the third night since meeting their new companions, Sycamore took the first watch with Walleye. They sat silently in their thoughts, enjoying the warmth of the small fire they maintained that cut through the gentle chill of the spring night. Sycamore slowly scanned the area around their camp, keeping himself awake by practicing his Speaking and soul magic exercises. He’d spent much of his time practicing those skills on the road, and he found himself gaining in strength and finesse quickly. He’d yet to test the new limits of his speaking, but where he once saw a person’s essence as an indistinct mass of light, now he saw a glowing orb with looping tendrils of energy, a resplendent living mass. Such was his progress that he even felt excited when he was distracted enough from his worry and fear.

His watch passed quietly, and when he decided enough time had passed, he awoke Lupin to replace him. He gently shook the other boy by the shoulder. Lupin’s hand snapped up, clenching Sycamore by the wrist. A slurred, angry mutter escaped his lips, and his eyes flitted open. Sycamore waited patiently as the grogginess in Lupin’s eyes faded to awareness until he released his grip.

“I thought you were one of the foxes, runt, come to raid the coop,” Lupin said as he roused himself. He’d called Granite’s trio ‘foxes’ since they’d met in a childish effort to bait an angry reaction.

“It’s your watch,” Sycamore said.

“With Walleye, yes, and then Granite. Go, get your sleep. I’ll make sure they don’t sneak off with our valuables,” Lupin said. Sycamore was unsure of exactly what valuables Lupin was talking about, but he did not want to argue the point, so he found his own resting spot, wrapped his cloak about him, and swiftly fell asleep.

-----

Sycamore jolted awake with a calloused hand pressed over his mouth. His eyes shot open. Granite knelt over him, face close enough that Sycamore could smell his breath, hot and rotten from travel. He felt a surge of panic as it occurred to him that Lupin had been right that they were not to be trusted after all, and he was about to try to force a yell when Granite spoke.

“Easy now, lad, I don’t mean to startle you, but silence is needed, here. Lupin and I spotted some folk moving in the darkness, bandits if we’re not mistaken. They’re slowly coming up on us, so we’re looking to give them a surprise when they try something. Lupin said you’ve held yourself in a fight before, so do whatever you need to get yourself ready. Give me a nod if you understand.” Sycamore felt himself blinking rapidly as he tried to process what Granite said. The man’s rough hand still covered Sycamore’s mouth, preventing him from asking any of the dozen questions that had burst into his mind. After his thoughts caught up, he nodded, and Granite continued, “I need to go rouse the others, so prepare yourself. Stay quiet and don’t make any big movements. We wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise.” He rose to a crouch with a final whispered, “Wait for the signal and prepare to skewer some scum.” Before Sycamore could ask what the signal was, he trotted over to where Mrs. Maple lay and clamped a hand over her mouth.

Sycamore slowly shifted around in his cloak, adjusting his position on the ground to allow himself to jump quickly to his feet. He reached out to his left, where the sword he had taken from the Fireglass raider sat in its sheath, propped against a rock. He took the hilt in his hand and soundlessly unsheathed it. Meanwhile he felt the cool night breeze, connected to its thrum of power, and started twisting the air above him in a spiral. His heart thumped in his chest, and he craned his neck from where he lay, scanning his surroundings for any sign of the bandits. His night vision was poor, though, and from where he lay he could see little that was not obscured by brush and other features of the land.

Minutes passed in tense silence, taxing Sycamore’s focus as panicked questions danced into his mind. How many bandits were there? Were they members of the Fireglass? Would he be able to see enough to fight in the night? Had he somehow missed the signal? The last he dismissed, knowing that if a fight had started he surely would notice it, but on the other questions his mind drifted to the worst possible answers. He recalled Lupin’s story of hundreds of Fireglass raiders in their village, feared that they were pursuing the remainder of the Heartwood clan. He cursed the decision to leave the Magus’s Library, feared that he might accidentally hurt one of his friends in the coming fight. 

His panic and fear shouted in his mind so loudly that he barely noticed when he heard movement outside their camp, far to the right of where he lay. He strained his neck, searching for the source of the noise. He noticed the pair on watch in the firelight. Lupin sat feigning a hunched-forward sleep, jaw clenched and sword sheathed across his lap. Granite sat leaning against a tree, looking much more natural in his faked slumber, and only the glint of the firelight off his barely-open eyes revealed that he was actually awake, facing the direction of the sounds. 

The sounds grew slowly closer until a group of five slunk slowly into the firelight. Sycamore couldn’t make out whether they were armed in the light, but relief washed over him when he realized they weren’t members of the Fireglass. And if there were only five of them, Sycamore’s group actually outnumbered them in fighters. 

The group approached the camp with soft steps. They were dressed in a mixture of clothing, ragged leather jerkins and stained linen clothes. They looked rugged in the firelight, but then so had Granite’s group. They whispered softly amongst themselves, too softly for Sycamore to make out. From the way their faces twisted into silent laughter, he figured they were mocking Sycamore’s group for being so unprepared for danger.

Sycamore looked them over for weapons. One held a heavy-looking piece of wood over his shoulder, some kind of cudgel. Two others had rusty shortswords. Another carried a woodcutting axe, and the final carried a wicked looking curved dagger that glinted off the firelight. 

The bandit with the dagger stepped past the fire to where Granite sat, leaving the other four behind. He slowly crouched down in front of the gruff man, lifting the dagger and leaning close to Granite. Sycamore felt a wave of fear as he waited for his companion to do something. He felt a sickening moment of realization that Granite must have somehow fallen asleep while they waited for the bandits. Sycamore was about to call out, but he knew he would be too late to save the man.

Suddenly, Granite’s eyes shot open. He let out an angry yell, swinging one arm to crash into the side of the bandit’s head. With the other hand he took hold of the bandit’s wrist, twisting it until the dagger fell free.

Taking that as the signal, Sycamore seized the wind, and with an effort of will shot the cloak covering him into the air in a burst of wind. He leapt to his feet, swinging his sword around him as he threw the wind in a gust towards the group of bandits. Around the camp, Sycamore’s companions came alive, climbing to their feet with angry yells, weapons in hand and ready to fight. Granite and his bandit struggled on the ground, throwing rough punches at each other as they wrestled for advantage. The bandit managed a knee to Granite’s stomach, sending him sprawling. Now free, the bandit scrambled for his dagger, grabbing it and turning to go after Granite, but Walleye was there, sword in hand. Sycamore trusted the two men to handle themselves, turning back to the rest of the bandits. Marrow, Pike, and Lupin moved to flank the remaining bandits, who were just now recovering from the shock of their presumed-sleeping targets leaping into the fight.

Sycamore ran to even the numbers, but a thought occurred to him. He swung his free hand in an upward arc, guiding the wind to scoop up embers from the fire. Hot ash, soot, and still-smoldering coals were kicked into the air, thrown onto the bandits. Through a stroke of luck, some of the ash blinded one of the bandits holding a sword. She clawed at her eyes as Marrow stepped forward with a swing of his sword. The heavy blow bit deeply into the bandit’s neck, and she collapsed to the ground, head nearly detached from her shoulders. With an outraged yell, cudgel-user swung at Marrow. The old man was still pulling his sword free, and so was unable to fully dodge the blow. He raised a wrist to block it, and the cudgel connected with a wet crack. Lupin swung at the bandit with his sword, missing twice before Marrow, hand now dangling uselessly at his side, kicked at the man’s knee, upsetting his balance enough that Lupin managed a slash across his side.

Meanwhile, Pike swung his spear in wide arcs, trying to keep his distance from the other two bandits. The axe-wielder hefted an overhand blow, and Pike attempted to block it with the haft of his spear. The wood was not strong enough, though, blocking most of swing’s force but shattering in Pike’s hands. The bandit heaved the axe back over his shoulder, making to swing again. Sycamore dashed to help his friend, leaping over the smoldering fire, swinging his sword. He missed the axe-wielder with his slash but collided with the man bodily, sending them both tumbling to the ground. There was a tangle of limbs as Sycamore wrestled for freedom, but the bandit was stronger, and wrapped Sycamore’s neck with a thick arm. The man squeezed tightly, and Sycamore felt blood rushing to his head as his breath cut off. Sycamore grabbed upwards with his hands, clawing at the bandit’s face, gouging his eye with a thumb. The man cried out in pain, thrusting Sycamore away from him. He took a dizzy breath, trying to regain his focus as his head throbbed.

Fearing for his life, Sycamore turned towards the enemy, trying and failing to feel his connection to the wind. He let out a relieved sigh, collapsing on his haunches when he saw pike standing over axe-wielding bandit, his broken spear thrust between the man’s ribs. Lupin was seated panting on the ground next to the corpse of the second sword-wielder. Marrow sat between the bodies of the cudgel-user and the first sword-wielder, cradling his ruined wrist in his lap. If Granite and Walleye had handled the bandit with the dagger, that meant all were accounted for.

“Sycamore!” Mrs. Maple called out in a frantic voice. Sycamore whirled to where she was standing, fearing for the safety of Hickory of Mist. He moved towards her as fast as he could, pushing off the daze from the fight. She was huddled over Walleye, who had a pale, vacant look on his face. Her hand was pressed to his throat, and blood flowed between her fingers, covering her.

“Are we okay?” Walleye muttered, “Is everyone safe?” His voice was breathless, weak.

“He was cut in the neck!” She said, “I’m afraid he’ll bleed out!” Sycamore walked over to the man, kneeling down next to him.

“There’s nothing to be done for Walleye,” Granite said with a grim tone, “The blade nicked the artery in his throat. He’ll be dead in moments.” Granite was seated on a rock, rubbing at his temple. On the ground next to him was the corpse of the final bandit, that wicked curved dagger buried in one of his eyes. Sycamore ignored the man, reaching out with his healers touch. Walleye’s was much dimmer than usual, and was dimming quickly.

“I don’t want to die,” Walleye muttered, “I told my Ma there was no danger in the caravan.”

“Move your hand,” Sycamore ordered, and Mrs. Maple quickly obeyed. Thankfully, though there was actually not much damage, a small but deep cut that would not be taxing to heal. Sycamore placed his fingertips atop the cut, ignoring the way the blood came out in spurts with Walleye’s heartbeat. Cool routine of hundreds of healings took over, denying him the freedom to panic.

“Let him die in peace!” Granite called, “fussing over him will just upset his passing.”

“I’m not going to die, am I?” Walleye Pleaded.

“No, you’re not going to die,” Sycamore said confidently as he pulled on Walleye’s soul, brought his essence to the wound. The man inhaled sharply, and Sycamore watched as the wound closed. After a moment, the healing was finished, and Sycamore sat back with a heavy sigh. It was lucky that the fight had ended so quickly, otherwise he would have been too late. Mrs. Maple looked from Walleye to Sycamore, and when Sycamore nodded at her, she too, sighed in relief.

“Is he gone?” Granite asked with the practiced emotionless of someone used to losing their companions. He stared at the ground, not looking at where Walleye lay.

“No, I’m – what did you do? The wound – it’s,” Walleye said, slowly sitting up as he prodded and poked where the wound had been.

At the sound of Walleye’s voice, Granite’s head shot up, eyes slowly widening as he looked back and forth between Sycamore and his companion. Sycamore, with a shrug, said, “I told you he wouldn’t die.”
