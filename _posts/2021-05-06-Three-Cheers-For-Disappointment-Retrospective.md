No album is closer to my heart than The Arrogant Sons of Bitches’ (shortened as ASoB) 2006 Ska-punk masterpiece _Three Cheers for Disappointment_ (shortened as 3CfD). This album, to me, is high school. It doesn’t remind me of high school or make me nostalgic for high school, it _is_ high school. Junior year, one day, I went on a field trip to some museum or another. That entire day, I listened to 3CfD. I bragged to a friend later that it was 13 times in a row (about 7 hours of nonstop 3CfD). I got in trouble in class for listening to music too loudly after finishing a calculus test – my dollar store earbuds bled noise when you cranked the volume too high. I remember my teacher yelling “whoever is listening to that godawful screaming, please turn it down.” It was track 2 of 3CfD. My bus ride to school was a little over an hour long – just long enough to get through two full listens of 3CfD. I remarked once, when discussing tattoos with a crush, that if I had to get a tattoo then and there, it would be of the lyrics “Three cheers for all the summer days,” the climactic line of the last track of the album, the most cathartic line I’ve ever heard in music. I listened to it in the shower, on the bus, during lunch, after school. If I could be listening to the album, I was. To call it a soundtrack to my life would be to understate my obsession. I probably heard Jeff Rosenstock’s voice more than my own (and considering my adoration for my own voice, that should be shocking).

Like I said, to me, 3CfD _is_ high school.

I look back now, with ten years of context and growth, in musical taste and maturity, and still, the album rings in my brain whenever I’m feeling a moment of angst or a burst of indignation. These moments in my life got me thinking about why this album worked – and continues to work - so well for me; why it still works as a release valve for those emotions we so strongly associate with high school – frustration, petulance, confusion, loneliness. And now, ten years after I first listened to the album and fifteen years after its release, I figured there’s no better time to go back over it, dissect its lyrics, music, and meaning, and reflect on the highs and lows of one of my favorite albums of all time. 

-----

## Part 1 – Genesis, or The People Behind the Album:


The Arrogant Sons of Bitches were a 6-piece Long Island-based DIY Ska-Punk band that made waves in the ska scene early in the 2000s, most notably for their DIY punk ethic(From the liner notes of 3CfD: “I recorded some sax, percussion and vocal parts in various bathrooms, bedrooms and friends’ practice spaces”) and high energy live performances. They self-released their first two albums before releasing _Three Cheers for Disappointment_ under Killnormal records. Their sound is a standout example of east coast ska-punk, with its raw, hardcore stylings as compared to the west coast style of poppier, upbeat party tracks (a la No Doubt and Reel Big Fish). Now, they are probably best remembered for their unapologetically crass band name and wild, untamed music, as well as for being the launching point of Jeff Rosenstock’s career. 

Along with the chaos came a strong sense of relatability. ASoB’s music comes off as human, unpretentious, and genuine. It sounds like a bunch of high school friends throwing down, because that’s what it was(“We got a case or two of beer, invited all of our friends down and we had a very difficult time getting things done”). The band started as a couple of friends playing Green Day covers together, and I swear I can hear that in their music. Like a good, old-fashioned friendship, it’s crass, confrontational, familiar, and friendly. 

It is impossible to talk about ASoB without mentioning that their front man was Jeff Rosenstock, a beloved figure in the DIY punk scene who continues to release new music as of 2021 – his most recent album, SKA DREAM, is my album of the year for 2021. ASoB was the first leg of Jeff’s career, and _Three Cheers for Disappointment_ was its swansong. The recording of this album was long, tumultuous, and ostensibly broke up the band. There was a breaking point, here, but when the dust finally settled and the album was released, it was a chaotic, bombastic masterpiece of high-octane ska that encapsulates the untamed identity that ASoB had carved for themselves. In many ways, this album serves as an explanation of Jeff’s motivations as he moved on to his next musical project, Bomb the Music Industry!(more on them later)

</p>

Of course, while Jeff Rosenstock’s lasting presence in the punk scene makes it very easy to focus on him, it should not be forgotten that this is not a Jeff Rosenstock album, but an Arrogant Sons of Bitches album. It was the efforts of all involved that produced such a powerhouse of an album, and though I might focus on Jeff in much of what I write throughout this retrospective, I don’t want to understate how many people put work into the production (the people thanked in the notes make up an absolute crowd). The recording of such a musical behemoth must have required a herculean effort from all sides. 

Before I get into the music itself, I want to present an excerpt from the original liner notes of the album(found [here](https://quoteunquoterecords.com/qur023.htm), along with the album for free, legal download!) to give a sense of the type of band ASoB was. I strongly recommend anyone who is at all interested in ASoB or 3CfD give the notes a full read-through. The context they provide to the album adds another layer of enjoyment to the music. For now, though, just this bit should put you in the right frame of mind to dive into _Three Cheers for Disappointment_:

“I would like to invite you, the listener, the reader, to create a new underground. One where we actually don’t have to follow any sets of rules. One where we don’t have to be controlled by anyone but ourselves. This is an album about breaking out of that old system. Hope you enjoy it fucker.”

### Interlude: What’s in a (song) name?:

Those unfamiliar with 3CfD or Jeff Rosenstock’s discography in general will quickly notice that he has a particular naming sense. The two names I’ve associated with him so far, The Arrogant Sons of Bitches and Bomb the Music Industry! Should be an indicator that the man has an appreciation for shocking, abrasive names. We get to see many of those names on 3CfD, clever, profane, and confusing. Below, I have provided a ranking from worst to best of the song titles of 3CfD, with a brief explanation for the placement on the list:

* 1-800-ALARM-ME - One of these had to be in last place, and I settled for this one. The song’s still brilliant though.   
* Have Fun Rotting by Yourself - Angry and spiteful, but not as clever as some of the others.   
* The Last Bell I Will Ever Hear - you say it’s the last bell, ASoB, yet it’s the first song on the album???????   
* Last on My List - It’s difficult to provide any commentary on this song name when I understand the context, so I’ll just say I like it.   
* “Yeah, I Don’t Know What It’s Like to Be Around a Bunch of Hipsters” - I figure this one might rank higher if I knew the context of the quote, and who said it.   
* Piss Off - Simple. To the point. Not bad   
* So Let’s go Nowhere - Somehow, the ethos of the song is perfectly captured in these four words.   
* Kill the President - it was difficult to explain to my mom why I googled “kill the president” on our family computer   
* Disappointment at the Taco Bell - truly there is a specific variety of disappointment that can only be felt at fast food establishments after 2 AM   
* Rocketrocketrocketship - scientifically, 3 rockets is the perfect amount. The doctoral thesis is forthcoming on my research.   
* I’ve got Enemies in High Places - A punchy inversion of "I've got friends in high places." Usually, big shots for enemies is not something to brag about, but it works here.     
* People Pops and Fudgesickles for the Hit Factory - the commodification of music rendered into clever imagery. Brilliant.   
* (I Must Be a Proctologist Because) All I Do is Deal With Assholes - Fantastic as a one liner and extremely topical. We have a winner.

## Part 2: The Meat of this Thing, or A Song-by-Song look at The Lyrics and Music:

A shrill mish-mash of horns, a countdown from ten, and it’s a galloping start on “The Last Bell I Will Ever Hear”. Jeff, angry at a relationship, is sick of being controlled and laments the collapse with a decisive “if I never see you again it’ll be too soon!” Into the next track, “(I Must Be a Proctologist Because) All I Do is Deal With Assholes,” Jeff calls out the fake friends who will, even in his death, use him for sympathy. In a particularly clever moment he screams:   

And when I’m gone tomorrow, you’ll talk to your new shiny friends and you’ll lie when you claim to care:   
“Let’s have a toast to our old friend.” “He’ll be there in our memories.”  
Go fuck yourself I won’t waste my time there.  

In the next track, “So Let’s Go Nowhere” Jeff sees the world crumbling around him, shouting at the top of his lungs that “everything is always falling apart”. Unlike the first two, though, this one punctuates with an optimistic note, as with a final wheeze, voice giving out, Jeff rasps, “Don’t fall apart!”

These first three songs are a rapid-fire start to the album, with seamless transitions that set a breakneck pace of ideas. They paint a picture of discontent with relationships and the world at large, setting the standard for the emotional beats of the entire album. Jeff is pissed, here, pissed at everyone, pissed at the world. The delivery reflects this, the words screamed more than sung, the horns blaring atop heavy drums and guitar. Jeff tumbles over the words in many places, his anger outpacing his enunciation.

I take these tracks as a launching point of the album. I remarked, years ago to my brother, that 3CfD is almost a “progression of aggression” where the qualms start small and get bigger. Here at the start, Jeff points out personal grievances, shallow and controlling friends, a constant sense that things are tearing at the seams. There are moments here of musical euphoria, from the countdown to “You can kiss my ass!” in the first song to the shouted “It’s so easy to just give up!” at the end of the second. But the best of the bunch is no doubt “So Let’s Go Nowhere!” a contender for best song on the album. It has supremely witty moments, like when he intentionally misquotes himself: “I hate to quote this song all wrong, but “Why Can’t We Still Be Friends!”, and it has moments of unexpected optimism: “It’s gonna rain tonight, but it’s gonna stop eventually. Let’s anticipate the sun and warmth and raise our fists and say, ‘everything is always falling apart, but I can’t!’” With the music, it whisks you into a torrent of energy, and I find it hard to resist screaming along with the chorus, no matter the setting (I want to say that it wouldn’t go over so well on a crowded commuter train in Japan). In these lyrics, too, you can see some those high school emotions: “Fuck the world. Everything is breaking and changing, and everything inside of me is breaking and changing!” Tell me you didn’t feel that way at one point in high school, and I’ll call you a liar. 

The next song on the album, the delightfully titled “Kill the President” – I’m sure I’m on some government list from googling for lyrics over the years – starts with perhaps the only song lyric that I look back on as cringey: “What’s the bullshit for? Verbal battlefields, syllables of war.” The start is the low point on the track, though, and the rest of the song is more of the same brutally depressing lyrics over upbeat punk. This was my favorite back in high school, and looking at the lyrics, I can see why. Below, I provide a list of lyrics from the song that could have appeared in a journal of mine on a particularly angsty day:
*	Over and over again, I’m so useless. Now you’re becoming everything, well was I ever anything?  
*	No one in this world is every listening! Pay attention now!  
*	It feels like seventh grade again, and none of this will ever end.  
*	In the cold, all alone, I’ve been thinking of everyone but you.  
* I shut myself off, and it happens again: You’re not my friend, you’re not my friend, you’re not my friend.  
*	Everyone I love always hates me! My judgement’s been off every time  
* This time I’d really rather be alone, can we forget this, I can just go home  

Yikes, I was an angsty kid. But it works here, cementing the feelings of the first three tracks, anger at the world that resolves in a potent way, especially for anyone who’s ever dealt with suicidal thoughts: “At home alone again all night. Expect the worst and you’ll be right.” A stark contrast from the chaos-clad optimism of “So let’s Go Nowhere!”, “Kill the President” serves as the other side of the coin, if we let our depression and anger overcome us to the point of drastic action.

Next (after a bizarrely long voicemail transition) we move into the “I hate the music industry” portion of the album, with “People Pops and Fudgesicles for the Hit Factory.” Jeff’s moved from hating on fake friends to hating on fake bands, telling them off with the scathing: “Stop singing, oh, so I can kick the rotting carcass of your sound.” Ouch. What’s worse, he hits them with “your pants are uncomfortable.” How will they ever recover? 

“RocketRocketRocketship,” musically, leans harder on the “Ska” part of ska-punk, at least for the first part. Lyrically, it’s a bit more abstract, but in context Jeff seems to be upset at the social aspects of his status in the music industry: “When (...) everybody’s telling me that we’re best friends, I’d rather be dead or dying.” This is especially apparent when we consider the audio clip played as a transition from the previous track: “What you got, is a whole, miserable subculture.” He then segues these complaints about the culture into lamentations over how he feels like he’s accomplished nothing. Finally, we see a bit of what seems to be one of Jeff’s takeaways from his time in ASoB: “United we can make our own destiny, come on, nobody’s with me!” Here, we start to see the crux of Jeff’s issues with the indie scene and the music industry at large.

I’m not sure you could call “Rocketrocketrocketship” a slow song, but it certainly feels like a break when compared to the aggressive pace of “1-800-ALARM-ME”, a continuation of Jeff’s ideas of unfulfilled dreams explored on the previous song. There’s an inescapable rhythm to this song, and I have fond memories of skanking to Jeff’s angry listing of his meager accomplishments. The lyrics here are almost uncomfortably familiar to me: “I’m a waste of life, a waste of mind. Where’s my ambition?”, “I lay in bed and think of all the dreams I’ve had and clever remarks I have said. It seems like they all mean nothing.” I feel personally called out. The lethargic conclusion to this song is Jeff’s resolution to his dissatisfaction; he gives up, shouting over and over that he wants to “stay asleep forever”. It’s a sad, relatable feeling we get whenever we’re overwhelmed.

“I’ve Got Enemies in High Places” is the capstone to the “Jeff vs. the music industry” part of the album, a hectic succession of fed-up thoughts and angry proclamations, particularly regarding the business side of the music scene, backed with frantic instrumentation. There are some absolute gems in the lyrics, like: “I do it ‘cause I like it, and I like it because you don’t”. This was another favorite of mine in high school, because of the brilliant intro, the solos, and the way the voices bounce around throughout the song.

From here, we move into the final leg of the album, focused more on Jeff’s personal ideology. “Disappointment at the Taco Bell” is a reflection on the differences of opinion Jeff has compared to those around him. Musically, the most standout part of this song is the bass, which absolutely shreds, something I didn’t notice until writing this retrospective.

“Piss off” is an odd conundrum in my analysis of the album, in that it doesn’t quite fit with my “progression of aggression” theory, and feels closer thematically to the first four tracks than any in this last leg. It’s a spiteful takedown of what sounds like an ex-girlfriend. Still, far be it from me to criticize ASoB, because the song fits here, somehow. It’s spiteful, delightfully chaotic, and has some of the most fun horn parts on the album.

The one ballad on the album, “Have Fun Rotting by Yourself” is a gesture of surrender to the parts of society that Jeff disdains. He makes his point perfectly clear with his repeated shouting of “It’s me verses them!” Over gang vocals. It’s anthemic, and speaks to the part of me that, whenever things get too bothersome, feels like “running far away from my problems.”

The penultimate track, “Yeah, I don’t Know What It’s Like to Be Around a Bunch of Hipsters” is my brother’s favorite song on the album, and I can see why. The composition is fantastic, gaining energy like a snowball rolling down a hill (the production is full of surprises – listen for the chimes). In most other contexts, I would say this should be the final track of the album, summarizing Jeff’s views on music and life: “Your concrete morals mold life’s prison cells and with fashion as warden, you’re prisoners in hell in your world. Rot in hell in your world. I’m not changing for your world.” However, the song ends abruptly, almost prematurely. It’s a setup for the final song, a bomb of a track that provides context for the disillusionment in the rest of the album.

“Last on my List” is an emotional tour-de-force, tragic and cathartic with its honest portrayal of the shock of losing someone you love. The song is a response to the sudden death of one of Jeff’s friends, cataloguing his response. Anyone who’s ever gone through loss will connect with the first lyrics: “I wish I could be mad and break something” belted over stripped back instrumentation, just guitar and singing. And from there, it does not go easy, layering in the emotions and instruments. The chorus hits like a truck, all instruments dropping out for a pause as Jeff opens the chorus with a scream: “I only wish this could be your pen across the page, and I only wish this could be a song for you to sing, and I only wish that it was me in the car that day.” The final idea of the song comes when Jeff, in an uncharacteristically soft voice, starts to say “How I long to share eternal life with you” repeatedly as things slowly layer back to a final screamed chorus and the emotional climax of the album: “If we had just another day, we’d have a ball instead of pissing it all away. Three cheers for all the summer days!” It provides context for the anger, frustration, angst from the last 40 minutes. I called it the most cathartic moment in music I know, and I stand by it. 

“Last on my List” is a transcendental song. I can count on one hand the number of songs that have sent legitimate chills down my spine, and the first finger is reserved for this track. Considering its placement on the album, it serves as the culmination of all the anger and outrage from the last 12 tracks, throwing out an eruption of raw emotion that feels real and earnest. However, on its face, it is a little difficult to connect this song to the rest of the album. Sure, it’s as angry and chaotic as the rest of this album, but it’s a different brand of anger, outrage at circumstance more than anything else. It could be easy to chalk up the track as a tribute to a passed friend and leave it at that. However, I believe that circumstances like they are described in “Last on my List” are exactly what drives Jeff’s personal convictions as described in the rest of the album. If the first 12 songs ask the question “What motivates someone to be this angry and driven in his convictions?” then “Last on my List” answers this question with a “When things are as miserable and broken as they are, there’s nothing we can do but make the most of our time.” Encapsulated within that “Three cheers for all the summer days!” is a demand to make the most of each moment and “have a ball instead of pissing it all away”. It’s an inspiration, really, and the reason why I told my crush those years ago that I want those words tattooed on me somewhere.

And that’s the end of the album. Well, not quite. After the smash-out of “Last on my List,” there’s a spoken coda: “One more, one more track!” as if even the band is greedy for just another song of brilliance from this thing. When the album ends there, there’s nothing to do but turn on track 1, listen to that mish-mash of horns and countdown from ten, and start the whole thing over again.

### Interlude: Stray Thoughts About Songs

In an effort to streamline part 2 of this review (and I use 'streamline' loosely), I refrained from pointing out every single part of 3CfD that I adore. So in this section, I want to take a moment to touch on some of my favorite moments I didn’t mention before.

In “The Last Bell”, the delivery of the line “You can’t run my fucking life anymore” that leaps into the overlapped vocals is amazing.

For “Protologist”, I want to emphasize how heavy this track is. From the intro it’s a tidal wave of sound, and horns have never sounded heavier than in the pickup before the first verse.

Did you notice that “Nowhere” starts with “The autumn came in like concrete at my face.” and “Kill the President” starts with “The winter knocked on my door like a selfish bitch”? Just a little more credit to my theory that these two songs are two sides of the same coin. 

A friend of mine used to randomly message me: “All. Your. Favorite. Bands. Do. Coke. Sorry.” That’s my strongest memory of “People Pops”

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the handclaps in “Rocket^3Ship.” Handclaps will elevate any song from good to great.

“1-800-Alarm-Me” and “Enemies in High Places” have so much energy as a one-two punch of tracks, it completely alleviates any kind of mid-album lull that could possibly happen.

I love the trombone break in the middle of “Disappointment at the Taco Bell” and it serves as another example where Jeff’s delivery of the lyrics, in this case “I will not trust anyone again,” really adds to the weight of horn moments in the songs.

The jazzy feel of “Piss Off” really adds to the vibe. There’s really nothing quite like telling someone to piss off over a swung beat. The spite gets cranked up to eleven.

I love the way “Have fun Rotting by Yourself” manages to be one of the most energetic and angry songs despite remaining sedate in tempo. I also love how the lyrics in the liner notes are in all caps for the last verse.

“Bunch of Hipsters” is such a perfect build up to “Last on my List.” The way the drums come through whenever he says “All anyone in this world” really gives me the feeling of shifting up in intensity. Also, something about the drab delivery of the first line: "hey again, I hope you know you ruined my life" never fails to make me giggle.

There’s so much to say about emotions contained within “Last on my List” that it’s hard to focus on just one brilliant moment. Of course I talked about that climactic line, but there’s something so real about the sentiment of “Like everybody else, I have my own shit list, and I want you to know that you were at the bottom of it.” There’s such simplicity to the emotion in lines like this that it hits me especially hard with its earnestness.

Thanks for reading over some of my favorite parts. I know this thing is too damn long already, but if I’m gonna write about this album, I’m not skimping on the details.

## Part 3 – Themes, or Jeff, The Music Industry, and a Tale of Disappointment



<p align ="center">
  <img width="300" height="225" src="https://quoteunquoterecords.com/images/bands/btmibands.jpg">
</p>


If you’re still with me after that overly-detailed look at the songs and their lyrics, thank you. If you skipped to this part, that’s okay, too. I want to summarize and synthesize what I’ve learned from looking closely at the lyrics, mainly from two perspectives: the first is what this album says about Jeff Rosenstock and his development from Arrogant Son of Bitch to Bomber of the Music Industry, and the second is what this album said to me as an adolescent with the volume turned all the way up.

It is far more obvious to me now than it was ten years ago that this album was a turning point. Jeff explicitly points out in the liner notes that the moment he knew that ASoB was over was when they were wasting celebration time signing posters: “As we sat around signing shit instead of actually enjoying our accomplishment that we spent fucking YEARS on […] we all knew that this was never gonna be a band again ‘cause this is what being in this band would be like.” If we combine this obvious disdain for excessive merchandizing with the brutal takedown of the indie/punk scene in the middle leg of 3CfD, it’s easy to understand the trajectory of Jeff’s career. When ASoB was on hiatus, Jeff put together a handful of tracks, releasing them as the album _Album Minus Band_ under the artist name “Bomb the Music Industry!” and the rest, as they say, is history. 

Bomb the Music Industry! Developed a cult following as an iconoclastic collective of musicians who were obviously in it for the fun more than the money. They spat on many of the conventions of the music scene, eschewing formal merchandise for hand-made products and releasing all of their music for free under Jeff’s own label Quoteunquote records. Their ethics, eclectic musical style, and energetic live performances amassed a large underground fan base, and when they finally broke up, they did so after releasing another opus, _Vacation_ (Jeff really has a knack for making the last album his groups release an absolute banger).


<p align ="center">
  <img width="350" height="350" src="http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/qur051/cover.png">
</p>

If we look at what what made BtMI! so popular, it’s clear that so many of these ideas show their foundations on 3CfD. The disdain for the music industry is there, as well as the delight in pulling in as many influences and instruments as possible. Really, you could summarize a handful of the tracks off of 3CfD with the words “bomb the music industry” and it wouldn’t be inaccurate. Taking a closer look at 3CfD has given me, a huge fan of Jeff Rosenstock and all his musical work, a greater appreciation for the album and its place in the timeline of his career.

But for me, the angry high school student of 2011, none of that mattered. At that time I knew vaguely of Jeff’s later work (“I don’t love you anymore” was a youtube recommendation from something ASoB related), but I didn’t care about context or punk ethics back then. I liked ska because it connected two of my passions: the trumpet and being angry at the world. So while I didn’t connect to Jeff’s specific anger at the music industry, I did connect with his anger in general.

And if there’s one word to describe _Three Cheers for Disappointment_, it’s ‘angry’. Jeff’s spouting anger at anyone who will listen about any topic he can think of. Of course, much of his anger was informed by his experiences in a band, but even that anger I could connect with. After all, what is anger at the music industry but frustration at a system holding you back with its rigidity, rules, and expectations? If there is one thing any high school student understands, it’s throwing a tantrum about rules and the man holding you down. 

I strongly associate that disdain for systems of authority with high school, and I think that’s why 3CfD worked so well for me then. But is that feeling of pushing back against the system really unique to high school? Probably not, and that’s probably why the album continues to inspire me in moments of frustration at the bounds of a system. I think Jeff understood this too. Going back to the liner notes, he says: “What I remembered is that when I wrote this album that it was less a series of complaints and a stream of anger than it was a story about something I feel we all go through when we finally get out of high school and we are inundated with the feeling that we’re free from rules. […] We are not a part of the system we all hated. Year’s later, I am still having trouble dealing with the fact that I am still part of the system that we all hated. The truth is the minute you feel you’re breaking free of the big thing that is holding you down, you’re already locked up again.”

So boom, there it is, the secret to the timeless appeal of the album, why I look back on it so much more fondly than much of the other music I enjoyed in high school. The feelings on this thing are raw and universal. I felt the anger and indignation most strongly in high school, but just about everyone feels that grip of the system occasionally, limiting and restricting your movement while you struggle against it. And in those moments, I hear Jeff’s voice shouting in the back of my mind. Of course, those feelings wouldn’t land if the music wasn’t so damn good, but you already saw my feelings on the music in part 2 of this review.

### Interlude: Reviews from smarter people than me

I am not the only person who loves this album. In fact, I distinctly recall one of my earliest motivations to seek out _Three Cheers for Disappointment_ was a YouTube comment below the music video for “So let’s go nowhere,” which stated: “This is one of the best albums of all time.” Below, I have included some reviews from friends and family of mine:

**My brother Brad says:**

Perhaps the thing you'll notice on a first listen of this album is the breakneck pace.  This album is a rush.  Put this album on and drink deeply from a fountain of adrenaline.

On a second listen maybe you'll appreciate the diversity of genre.  From the crass party blowers at the start to the sonorous chimes at the end, you'll appreciate Jeff Rosenstock's breadth of musical vision.

On a third listen, you will probably begin to appreciate the raw and unfiltered stream of consciousness that is Jeff's songwriting.  This album is entirely appropriate for the adolescent whose newfound energy for life often manifests in crests and crashes of emotion.  But the brilliance of Jeff Rosenstock doesn't only apply to the hormone-overloaded. For the rest of us, he puts an unvarnished and authentic voice to those emotional movements that we've learned to keep hidden since our pubescence.  He gives a voice to the spiritual, social, and emotional landscape of our times.

On the fourth through thousandth listens, don't expect to get bored, either.  New insights and gems surface every playthrough.

## Part 4 – Conclusion, or 10 Years later, Still Giving Cheers to Disappointment

When I decided to write this retrospective, I wanted to bask in the nostalgia of high school and communicate my fondness for this album in a medium where no one can tell me to shut up if I go on for too long. I did not expect this retrospective to be 5000 words, nor do I regret putting those words on the page. I love this album as a catastrophe of anger and growth. There’s such a density of music and ideas that each time I come back, I can hear something new, understand something better. I can, and above did, talk about it for literally thousands of words. I listened to 3CfD dozens of times while drafting this retrospective, and I can conclude firmly that I love it more now than I did when I started writing this. At the beginning of this behemoth of a blog post, I wrote that to me, _Three Cheers for Disappointment_ represents high school. That will always be true. Now, after reflecting on it an unhealthy amount, I start to better understand exactly why this is the case. Few albums are better portrayals of going through anger, growth, and tragedy through unforgiving systems, failing friendships, and this sour set of circumstances that we call life. Call it high school, call it growing up, call it living in this world. As we live through each day, there’s nothing to do but throw up our arms and offer three loud, angry cheers for disappointment.

### Epilogue: Miscellaneous bits I want to say
This review/retrospective/word-vomit-on-a-blog has been a long time coming. Years and years ago, one of my older brothers wrote a much more concise review of 3CfD on my other older brother’s website. In the review he posited that 3CfD was the best rock album of the 2000s. It’s a bold claim, but, subjectively, I agree (in case my prior pontification did not tip you off). However, while I love this album and consider it to be an absolute masterpiece, it’s not even my favorite Jeff Rosenstock album. That honor would have to go to his 2016 solo work, Worry!, which is my absolute favorite album of all time. If 3CfD is high school to me, then Worry! Is college, specifically the second half of college. You can see a lot of what I love about Jeff’s songwriting style in both of these albums: his fantastic use of seamless transitions between songs, his rendering of huge or grandiose emotions into human moments, the way he manages to switch genres, the layers of optimism and cynicism he bakes into all of his tunes. In the back of my mind, I am self-critical over the fact that there seems to be such a lack of variety in my favorite music, it’s all Jeff or Jeff-adjacent. But at the same time, I can’t control the fact that his music hits me in a different way.

Back in 2015, I got a chance to meet Jeff after a show in New York City. I said some rushed line about how 3CfD got me through high school, thrust my sweaty trucker hat on his head(with my high school marching band’s signature ‘rumpet your trumpet’ plastered on the front) and snapped a picture. I regret the thing with the hat, I can’t imagine it feels nice to have someone’s sweaty cap slapped on you after playing a show. Still, he was a good sport about it and said something like “Thanks for the color!” with an awkward chuckle. That was also the show when I realized Dan P. (another musical idol of mine) is a member of the Death Rosenstock band. I have a shirt I bought from him and got him to sign several times over the years, and if I had known he was performing with Jeff, I would have worn it to the show. Years later Jeff came to Japan(where I currently live) but his show was in Tokyo on a Tuesday, and my laziness/depression/anxiety made me decide that I couldn’t make the trip (I totally could have if I wasn’t so lame). If you’re reading this Jeff, please come back to Japan, I need Dan P. to sign my shirt. I’ll make the trip, even if it’s on a Tuesday.

Anyway, if you read this far, thanks for everything. This blog is a fun exercise for me in 2021, and I don’t expect more than a few friends of mine to read it. If you somehow found this by accident and you haven’t yet listened to 3CfD, give it a shot! It’s not for everyone, and I didn’t even like it on the first listen. But if you give it a chance, I’m sure something will connect with you.
