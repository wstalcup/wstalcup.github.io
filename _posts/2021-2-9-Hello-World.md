On January 1st, 2021, I made a solemn vow to write 100 thousand words in the year of 2021. When the solemnity of the moment passed, I realized that the people must hear what I have to say. Thus, this blog, (soon to be) full of priceless insights on a variety of topics, including books, games, music, and anything else I'm bored enough to write about.

If you somehow find this blog and want to contact me about business inqueries (I'm open to speak at corporate retreats, bot mitzvahs, and christenings), please message me at wstalcup@gmail.com.
