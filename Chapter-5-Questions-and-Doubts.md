_When night came and we made camp, the boy asked, nervously, if he could continue to travel with us for a few more days. His youthful hesitance amused my companion and me, and we easily agreed – he’d proven generous and skilled by snaring the hare, and his company was a pleasant change of pace. In the morning, he asked whether our travels would eventually lead us in the direction of the Kingdoms. When I confirmed as much, he seemed relieved and shared that he was to make his way westward as well._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

The room around Sycamore shocked him. In the darkness, he had imagined the dull workings of a tomb, all stone and iron. When his vision adjusted to the brightness of the torches, he saw, instead, a library. Shelves of colorful tomes lined the walls, bound ornately with boards of wood, dyed leather, and in a host of styles. There were more books than he had ever seen, far more than the handful his mother kept around to identify herbs and keep anatomical notes. Central in the room stood an altar of white marble, veined in gold that reflected the torchlight. Beyond the altar was a desk topped with writing materials and a pot of ink that, from a distance, still looked to be wet. Sycamore tried to reconcile what he saw with the rocky hill outside, but felt as if he had been whisked away to some noble’s study instead of taken a dozen steps down a hidden flight of stairs. If this was a tomb, it was one far more extravagant than any Sycamore could imagine.

“Speak, boy, or would you prefer I returned us to darkness?” The voice of the hill said. In his surprise, Sycamore had nearly forgotten the booming presence.

“No,” Sycamore finally managed, “I prefer the light.”

“Then light you shall have,” The voice said. The voice was deep and cool, carried a man’s tone. It reverberated around Sycamore, bafflingly coming at him from every direction.

“Who are you? The voice of the wind?” Sycamore tried. He doubted as much, now, but had no other guess to go off.

“I’d ask you the same thing,” The voice said, “When I felt the use of magic of the soul, it woke me of my stupor. Thinking an apprentice of mine had returned, I tried to call to the user. Who should find me, but a young boy, apparently of the kingdoms but speaking the tongue of the Hillfolk.”

Sycamore understood little of what the voice said. A dozen questions bounced around his head, but finally one won out.

“You’ve said that twice, now,” Sycamore said, “that I speak the language of the Hillfolk. Why does this surprise you? Around here are only Hillfolk.” This was a term for all of Sycamore’s people. Not just his clan, but the surrounding ones as well. 

A pause. “You speak no lies? There are no... Westfolk, I believe you call them, around? No towns of farmers or frontiersmen?”

Sycamore considered a moment. He had heard of the Westfolk but knew little of them. Occasionally, in stories, his mother would mention far off western kingdoms of ambitious, greedy men and women who held little appreciation for nature, family, or health. Westfolk. These men and women often met grisly fates, some lesson on humility and appreciation.

“I’ve never seen or met a Westfolk, so there are surely none around here,” Sycamore finally answered.

“He says there are none, but stands in my presence.” The voice began muttering, drifting back to the language Sycamore didn’t know.

For a moment, Sycamore listened, waiting for it to address him. He looked around the room, eyes gravitating to the central altar, with its peculiar stone. Instinctively, Sycamore knew that this was the core of the voice’s essence. Whatever it was, it lay in the altar. Slowly, he approached the marble block, reaching to lay a hand on it.

“I would ask that you not touch that,” The voice said. Sycamore’s hand froze before falling back to his side.

“You answered my question – though in a way that only provokes more lines of inquiry – so I will answer yours. Ask, boy,” The voice said.

Sycamore mustered his courage, choosing a question to ask. They came in a flood. “Again, I ask, who are you? Some kind of specter? A man bound in isolation? I saw a man in my dreams, is that you? Why is your essence in this hill? What is this place?”

“Many questions, boy. Not all worth answering. For me, I am – was – a simple scholar of magic of the kingdoms. Some named me Magus out of respect, others Stoneeyes out of fear, but my mother named me Mikhail,” The voice said. “As for the man in your dreams, yes I am likely he. Some time ago I felt, with a shard of my vessel, the use of soul magic. Expecting, as I said, an apprentice of mine, I sent forth images that would be familiar to them. That you saw these images in dreams is of little surprise, for the soul is most ready for insight at such times. My soul – or essence as you term it – is bound here, my sanctum, my vessel, my body.”

Sycamore struggled to understand the voice’s – the Magus’s – words. He knew little of soul magic, apprentices, shards of the vessel. It only led to further questions.

“When you say soul magic, do you mean healing?” Sycamore asked.

“Hold, boy. Let’s have an exchange, hm? I answered your questions thoroughly, now please answer mine.”

Reluctantly, Sycamore nodded. His curiosity demanded he ask the Magus a thousand questions, but his senses of fear and courtesy told him to mind his manners.

“I presume you have no knowledge of the date by the standard calendar?” The Magus asked. Sycamore offered no reply. “Nothing so simple. Do you perhaps, then, have any knowledge of how long ago there stood, here, a tower?””

Sycamore had heard of no tower in this place. To the south of his village, there had been nothing but rocky hills for as far back as his memory reached.

“Are you sure it was here?” Sycamore said, “I’ve never heard of or seen any tower around this area.”

“You stand in the tower’s foundation, boy. I am quite sure it was here.”

“What happened, then, to this tower?” Sycamore asked, curiosity piqued.

“Brought down in a crusade against me. Seeking to suppress my research, my knowledge, a force of peacekeeping crashed down on the walls of my home. They hoped to end my existence, but their ignorance betrayed them. Thus, I am still here.”

Sycamore swallowed. His drive to answer the questions plaguing him had suspended his sense of danger, but hearing of such things returned some of those feelings.

“Then,” Sycamore said, “I don’t know. My clan only came to this place twenty years ago, so perhaps it was longer than that.”

“Twenty years, you say,” the Magus said with unreadable emotion. Finally he continued, “Boy, you act surprised to hear of my tower, yet you must have found a shard of it for my power to reach you.”

Sycamore pondered this, trying to match something in his memory with a shard of the Magus’s tower. Sycamore’s eyes widened as understanding dawned.

“You call someone’s essence their soul, and speak of soul magic,” Sycamore reached out with his Healer’s Touch, probing at the edge of the Magus’s essence, “Would you call this soul magic?” Again Sycamore marveled at the Magus’s condition – the essence in the rock felt human, alive, but with less defined borders, not constrained to a body like a normal person’s.

“Yes, and I am surprised to find one such as yourself capable of such things. In my time, there were great taboos surrounding the use of soul magic.”

“I don’t know of such taboos, but I can tell you that in my clan we call this magic healing, and use it as such. I suspect I came into contact with a shard of your tower when it became embedded in my leg,” He thought back to the thin sliver of stone, stabbing into his thigh, clutched in his hand when he awoke from his dreams of the Magus. “The stone was nearby when my mother healed my leg, which was likely the soul magic you felt.”

“Circumstance, then, led a bit of my vessel to injure you, then using your healing you brought my attention,” The Magus said, humming thoughtfully. “A sound theory. But still it introduces more questions. You say you use soul magic for healing, but where I come from it has a powerful reputation of destruction, not recovery.”

“Again, I only know what I’ve been taught by my mother,” Sycamore said, “Perhaps she knows how to destroy with your soul magic, but I only know of healing.”

“Hmm,” The Magus said, “Your mother, then, is she of the Hillfolk?”

“Of course. As I said, around here there are only Hillfolk.”

“A lapse in my judgement, then, to only research in the kingdoms,” The Magus said softly, “The language, I learned, but I did not examine their research. Distracted by the bias of culture, prejudice. Their magic, different, but still worth researching, perhaps.” He spoke again, in a louder voice, “Tell me, boy, what is your name?”

Sycamore felt a moment of hesitation. He knew little of the Magus’s power, but though he spoke in a confusing way, he had yet to bring any harm to Sycamore. 

“Sycamore,” he finally said.

“Sycamore, then,” The Magus replied, “Were you, perhaps, a foundling? Picked up as a babe by your mother?”

Sycamore blinked in shock. How could the Magus know that? Could he discern so much from just Sycamore’s name?

“Yes, I was,” Sycamore said. There was no point in hiding it since the Magus could clearly read his history, “Did you learn that from just my name?”

“No, not your name,” The Magus said, humor in his voice, “Sycamore, you are not of the Hillfolk. I do not know if it has been kept from you intentionally, or your mother is simply ignorant of the Westfolk, but when I first felt your presence and saw your face, I could easily tell that you are no Hillfolk clansman, but a man of the Kingdoms.”

Sycamore felt himself smiling, finding humor in the absurdity of the statement. “You jest, Magus. How could such a thing be true? As I have said multiple times now I’ve never met one of the Westfolk. It is certainly not possible that I am one.”
 
“Yes, I thought it odd that you spoke the Hillfolk language, but I would not have imagined that you were truly ignorant of your origins. Did you not notice the physical differences? You lack the Hillfolk’s large eyes, mouth, arms.” It was as if the Magus read down a list of Sycamore’s insecurities.

“Of course I’ve noticed such differences,” Sycamore said, becoming flustered that the joke continued beyond what he deemed funny, “I’ve been tormented for my physical defects for as long as I can remember. I do not need you to remind me of them.”

“Differences, certainly, but not defects,” The Magus said, “You said before you saw images of me in your dreams. You must have seen the similarities in features. I am one of the Westfolk.” Sycamore distinctly recalled that sense of familiarity with the man in his mind, too much in common to ignore.

“Yes, but,” Sycamore scrambled for explanation, “The man I saw was tall, much taller than me! Taller than anyone in my clan!”

“Yes, you certainly lack height now. I imagine you can’t be much older than ten years old, perhaps twelve?”

“On my fourteenth year, but still thirteen,” Sycamore said, panic, fear clutching at his sides.

“It follows, then, that soon you will hit your pubescent growth, and you’ll quickly outstrip your peers for height.”

“That cannot be true,” Sycamore said. In his mind, years of insults bounced around – that he did not belong, that he was somehow broken from birth, that his mother only kept him around out of pity. The Magus’s words confirmed these insults. He was different. An outsider. When he noticed the features of the dream man, he vaguely hoped for acceptance, not this.

“I speak truly, Sycamore.” His words with little emotion, uncaring that he shattered Sycamore’s identity.

“No! You lie!” Sycamore shouted. Of course it was a lie. He could not trust the voice of a Magus. In fact, Sycamore began to doubt whether the voice spoke truly of anything. It was a snare, to rope him in, exploit his doubts, then to somehow capitalize on them.

“I did not mean to upset you, Sycamore,” The so-called Magus said.

“Is this your trap then? Find a doubt of mine, reveal some hidden truth? And then what, ensare my essence?”

The voice said nothing, confirming, in Sycamore’s mind, the truth of his accusations.

He turned to leave, to climb the steps and free himself from this trickster.

“Return when you’ve calmed and we can seek understanding of each other.” The voice said as sycamore climbed the stairs. Sycamore swore he sensed sadness in the voice, regret, but that was no doubt another trick.

Sycamore heard the hill shift as he exited the stairwell, knew it must have closed behind him. He found himself gaining speed as he fled the Magus’s hill. He had come searching answers, and instead found doubts.

-----

He was late to his lesson with Jackdaw that evening. Alone with his thoughts, wandering aimlessly, he did not return to the village until the sun had begun to set. When he had finally arrived at their meeting place, Jackdaw offered no words of complaint, perhaps seeing the distraught look on Sycamore’s face.

Sycamore struggled to repeat his earlier success with Speaking. His brother praised him when he mentioned manipulating a current of wind that day, but, lacking in focus or energy, he was unable to duplicate such feats. Eventually, Jackdaw ended their lesson early, deciding that Sycamore would rather benefit from some personal reflection.

Dinner was much the same, distracted mumbles whenever his mother asked him a question. After their meal, Jackdaw bid his farewells, reminding Sycamore of his obligations the next day – another day in the forge – and left to settle his business for the evening.

“Speak up, Sycamore, what plagues you?” His mother asked as they finished cleaning up after their meal. She settled into a chair by the fire. The weather had started to warm with the spring, but still, the nights bit with cold. 

Sycamore took his own place near the fire, staring into its dancing tails until spots darkened his vision. He did not know what he should say to his mother. He trusted her, instinctively, but the Magus’s words had planted a seed of doubt. He feared rebuke if he told her of his recklessness in following his instinct into the hill. Never had he heard of something such as an underground library, hidden within the earth, but vengeful spirits and ethereal tricksters were often the subject of nighttime stories. 

Deciding to keep the specifics of his afternoon experience a secret, he spoke of what occupied him, “Tell me the story of how you found me, Mother.” He knew she watched them, but feared to meet her gaze, that she might detect some doubt in his eyes.

She began to speak with the low, vivid voice of a strong memory. “Thirteen years ago, an autumn morning. As I often do, I woke early to forage for useful herbs. An inkling of something, a whisper on the wind, told me to, instead of my usual northbound travels to the Songwood, head west. At the time, I did not know what to expect, but when the wind speaks, there is naught to be done but listen. Following my instinct, the whims of the wind, I walked with purpose until, to my surprise, I heard the mewls of a babe.”  

“Me,” Sycamore said, turning to her. She smiled down at him with her wide mouth and large eyes, so unlike his own.

“Yes. Nestled between two bushes, naked in the morning cool, you. Fearing for your health, I used my Healer’s Touch, but was surprised to find that your essence was powerful, strong with the will to live. I wrapped you with a scarf, brought you back here.”

“You did not think it odd to find a baby alone in the wilderness? You just decided to take me in?”

“The wind spoke to me, and I simply listened. I had not expected to find you, of course, but I could hardly leave a crying infant to the whims of nature,” She said, “But why do you ask of such things, my sapling? What ails you?”

“Was I deformed as a baby, too?” Sycamore asked, acid coming to his voice, “were my eyes small and lifeless, my hair black like soot?”

“To my eyes you were a beautiful child,” His mother said, “You still are. Do not take stock of what others say, Sycamore. Your features are natural, normal in their own way.”

“How can it be that my features are normal? I resemble nothing of our clan. Perhaps I’m -” His doubts took form. “I’m not Hillfolk at all. Destined to always be an outsider.”

His Mother took on a concerned look, seeing that this was more than a bout of his normal insecurities, “Who told you such things? Was it the smith’s boy? Rhubarb always loved him too much for discipline.”

“It does not matter who told me these things, Mother, for they are true. I’m no member of this clan, but a parasite, only tolerated because our people respect you.”

“Sycamore,” Her voice took on a firm tone, and she rose from her chair, “You are my son. I do not know from where these thoughts come, but rid yourself of them. That day I took you in thirteen years ago, you became a member of our clan. Every day when you heal the ails of our people, help in their work, you prove yourself to them. To name yourself as outsider insults the very basis of our family, our clan. I won’t have you say such things under my roof.” She approached him and embraced him, but emptiness filled him. Nowhere had she denied the words of the Magus. He may be her son, but he was no Hillfolk.

Sycamore woke in the night to the sound of desperate shouts. Groggily he began to sit up, and across the room, he heard his mother rising as well. She quickly stood, wrapping a cloak around the shift she wore and pulling on shoes. 

“Come, Sycamore,” She said, “Those screams are in pain.”

 He felt focus, honed from years of training, supersede his drowsiness as they left their house into the dark evening.

They found the girl surrounded by a group of their clansmen. She was being swarmed, surrounded by demands to know why she was shouting at this time of night and what was going on.

“Give the girl some space,” Sycamore’s mother barked as they came to the crowd. Hearing her voice, the group spread to let her through. At the center of the crowd, they found Juniper, a young woman a few years Sycamore’s senior. She lived far to the outskirts of their village with her father, and Sycamore scarcely saw her outside of festivals. She was gasping for breaths, obviously having sprinted here from wherever she came. When she spotted Sycamore and his Mother, her eyes widened, and she reached out, grasping his mother’s clothes.

“Miss Poppy,” She said, “Come quick, my father is hurt, he’s not responding, I can’t-”

“Slow, Juniper, I can scarcely understand you.”

“There’s no time to be slow!” Juniper yelled.

“I can hardly help if I do not understand the situation,” Sycamore’s mother said. There was no heat in her voice. She knew that in a crisis most people lost firm control of their emotions.

Juniper grit her teeth, but eventually responded in a more controlled tone, “My father did not return from his hunt this evening. I thought it strange, so I went looking for him. When I found him, he-“ Her voice broke, and she gasped as a sob seized her.

“Lead me to him,” Sycamores mother said. She turned to the crowd, “One of you, fetch the Head, tell him to follow after us.” She turned to the north, beckoning Juniper to lead as she took off at a brisk walk. Sycamore followed closely behind the pair, a deep feeling of unease taking hold in his stomach.

For a long time, they walked. The silence of the night only interrupted by the sounds of their footfalls and intermittent gasps and sobs from Juniper. Eventually, Jackdaw caught them, carrying a torch with him.

When they found the corpse, it was clear some animals had gotten to it. Flesh was torn where wolves had taken bites out of limbs, stiff with death. Flies circled the body, landing on bruised skin. The air smelled of blood and sick and waste, the coppery, rotten smell of death. Sycamore felt bile rising in his stomach, but forced it back. He had seen a corpse before, though not in such condition. Next to him, Juniper went limp, falling to her knees, clinging to his mother. Her voice rose, and the cool, dark night filled with screams of despair.
