_My Companion was a seasoned military woman, and maintained a rigorous training schedule. She often said that the secret to martial prowess was routine training until skills were ground into instinct. The boy regularly watched her practice with an expression of longing on his face. He had a routine of his own, some form of quiet meditation. One day she asked him if he’d ever used a sword. He nodded, but admitted he lacked any sort of skill. She offered to give him some training, and so her routine became his as well. As for me, I watched them while following my own routine, jotting jumbled notes in my journal._

Sycamore’s eyes shot open as he jolted awake. A calloused hand was pressed over his mouth. Granite knelt over him, face close enough that Sycamore could smell his breath, hot and rotten from travel. He felt a surge of panic as it occurred to him that Lupin had been right that their new companions were not to be trusted after all, and he was about to try to force a yell when the man spoke in a whisper.

“Easy now, lad, I don’t mean to startle you, but quiet is needed, here. Lupin and I spotted some folk moving in the darkness, bandits if we’re not mistaken. They’re slowly coming up on us, so we’re looking to give them a surprise when they try something. He said you’ve held yourself in a fight before, so do whatever you need to get yourself ready. Give me a nod if you understand.” Sycamore felt himself blinking rapidly as he tried to process what Granite said. The man’s rough hand still covered Sycamore’s mouth, preventing him from asking any of the dozen questions that had burst into his mind. After his thoughts caught up, he nodded, and Granite continued, “I need to go rouse the others, so prepare yourself. Stay quiet and don’t make any big movements. We wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise.” He rose to a crouch with a final whispered, “Wait for the signal and prepare to skewer some scum.” Before Sycamore could ask what the signal was, he trotted over to where Mrs. Maple lay and clamped a hand over her mouth.

Sycamore took a moment to process before slowly shifting around in his cloak, adjusting his position on the ground to allow himself to jump quickly to his feet. He reached out to his left, where his sword sat in its sheath, propped against a rock. He took the hilt in his hand and soundlessly drew it. He lacked any sort of skill with the weapon, but his sling would be useless in the darkness. Meanwhile he felt for the cool night breeze, connected to its thrum of power, and started twisting the air above him in a spiral. His heart thumped in his chest, and he craned his neck from where he lay, scanning his surroundings for any sign of the bandits. His night vision was poor, though, and from where he lay he could see little that was not obscured by brush and other features of the land.

Minutes passed in tense silence, taxing Sycamore’s focus as panicked questions danced into his mind. How many bandits were there? Were they members of the Fireglass? Would he be able to see enough to fight in the night? Had he somehow missed the signal? The last he dismissed, knowing that if a fight had started he surely would notice it, but on the other questions his mind drifted to the worst possible answers. He recalled Lupin’s story of hundreds of Fireglass raiders in their village, feared that they were in pursuit, seeking retribution for the Fireglass Sycamore’s group had slain. He cursed the decision to leave the Magus’s Library, cursed his shortsightedness and lack of caution.

His panic and fear shouted in his mind so loudly that he barely noticed when he heard movement outside their camp, far to the right of where he lay. He strained his neck, searching for the source of the noise. He noticed the pair on watch in the firelight. Lupin sat feigning a hunched-forward sleep, jaw clenched and sword sheathed across his lap. Granite, evidently finished waking everyone, sat leaning against a tree, looking much more natural in his faked slumber. Only the glint of the firelight off his barely-open eyes revealed that he was actually awake, facing the direction of the sounds.

The sounds from far off grew slowly closer until a group of five slunk into the firelight. Sycamore could not make out details of their appearance, but he saw enough to recognize that they were not Fireglass raiders. Relief surged with a kernel of hope. If there were only five bandits, Sycamore’s party would outnumber them and stand a fair chance in a fight, especially if the ambush went as planned.

The group of bandits approached the camp with soft steps. They were dressed in a mixture of clothing, ragged leathers and stained linens. They looked rugged in the firelight, but, then, so had Granite’s group. They whispered softly amongst themselves, too softly for Sycamore to make out. From the way their faces twisted into silent laughter, he figured they were mocking Sycamore’s group for being so unprepared for danger.

Sycamore looked them over for weapons. One held a heavy-looking piece of wood over his shoulder, some kind of cudgel. Two others had rusty shortswords. Another carried a woodcutting axe, and the final carried a wicked looking curved dagger that shined in the light of the fire.

The bandit with the dagger stepped past the fire towards Granite and Lupin. He paused as he passed Lupin, giving the boy a look before continuing to Granite. When he reached the man, he raised a hand to his companions, offering a vague sign of confirmation. He crouched down in front of Granite, lifting his dagger and leaning close to the man. Sycamore felt a wave of fear as he waited for his companion to do something, send up the signal. As the dagger drew near to Granite’s throat, Sycamore felt a sickening moment of realization that Granite must have somehow fallen asleep while they waited for the bandits.
 
Suddenly, Granite’s eyes shot open. He let out an angry yell, swinging one arm to crash into the side of the bandit’s head. With the other hand he took hold of the bandit’s wrist, twisting it until the dagger fell free.

Taking that as the signal, Sycamore seized the wind, and with an effort of will shot the cloak covering him into the air in a burst of air. He leapt to his feet, swinging his sword around him as he threw the wind in a gust towards the group of bandits. Around the camp, Sycamore’s companions came alive, climbing to their feet with angry yells, weapons in hand and ready to fight. The camp was suddenly a roar of wind and brawling. Granite and his bandit struggled on the ground, throwing rough punches at each other as they wrestled for advantage. The bandit managed a knee to Granite’s stomach, sending him sprawling. Now free, the bandit scrambled for his dagger, grabbing it and turning to go after Granite, but Perch was there, sword in hand. Sycamore trusted the pair to handle themselves, turning back to the rest. He spotted Gramps and Mrs. Maple, huddling around the children as Marrow, Pike, and Lupin moved to flank the remaining bandits. Their enemies were quickly recovering from the shock of the trap, and things were about to become bloody.

Sycamore ran to even the numbers of the fight, but a thought occurred to him. He swung his free hand in an upward arc, guiding the wind to scoop up embers from the fire in a heavy gust. Sparks, hot ash, and still-smoldering coals were kicked into the air, thrown onto the bandits. 

Through a stroke of luck, some of the ash caught one of the bandits holding a sword in the face, blinding her. She cried out in pain, clawing at her eyes as Marrow stepped forward with a swing of his sword. The heavy blow bit deeply into the bandit’s neck, and she collapsed to the ground, head nearly detached from her shoulders. With an outraged yell, the cudgel-user swung at Marrow. The old man was still pulling his sword free, and so was unable to fully dodge the strike. He raised a wrist to block it, and the cudgel slammed into his arm with a wet crack. 

Lupin rushed to Marrow’s aid, swinging at the bandit with his sword, missing twice. The bandit lurched out with his cudgel and struck a solid hit on Lupin’s shoulder. Marrow, hand now dangling uselessly at his side, kicked at the bandit’s knee, upsetting his balance enough for Lupin to draw a slash across his side.

Meanwhile, Pike swung his spear in wide arcs, trying to keep his distance from the other two bandits as they rounded on him. The second swordsman lashed out with a clumsy strike that Pike evaded, stepping towards the axe-wielder as he hefted an overhand blow. Unable to dodge, Pike caught the attack on the haft of his spear, but the wood was not strong enough. It blocked most of axe’s force but shattered in Pike’s hands, knocking him back on his rear. The bandit heaved the axe back over his shoulder, making to swing again. 

Sycamore dashed to help his friend, leaping over the smoldering fire, swinging his sword. He missed the axe-wielder with his weapon but collided with the man bodily, knocking the axe from his grip and sending them both tumbling to the ground. The collision jolted the sword from Sycamore’s hands and snapped his connection to the wind. There was a tangle of limbs as Sycamore wrestled for freedom. The bandit was stronger though, roughly wrapping Sycamore’s neck with a thick arm. The man squeezed tightly, and Sycamore felt blood rushing to his head as his breath cut off. Sycamore grabbed upwards with his hands, clawing at the bandit’s face, gouging his eye with a thumb. The bandit cried out in pain, thrusting Sycamore away from him. He felt skin tear off his shoulder as he roughly rolled across the ground. He slid to a stop, gasping a dizzying breath, trying to regain his focus as his head throbbed.

Fearing for his life, Sycamore turned towards the enemy, trying and failing to make a connection to the wind. There was a shout and a squelch of flesh, and Sycamore collapsed on his haunches. With a relieved sigh, he saw Pike standing over the axe-wielder, his broken spear thrust between the man’s ribs. Lupin was seated on the ground nearby, a jagged cut stretching across his cheek. Next to him the second swordsman was pinned through the stomach, sputtering blood between his lips with his last breaths as he tried futilely to pull at the sword in his gut, slick with blood. Marrow sat between the bodies of the cudgel-user and the first sword-wielder, cradling his ruined wrist in his lap. They were bloodied, but somehow had survived the fight.

“Sycamore!” Mrs. Maple called out in a frantic voice. Sycamore whirled to her voice, fearing for the safety of Hickory or Mist. He moved towards her as fast as he could, pushing off the daze from the fight. She was huddled over Perch, who had a pale, vacant look on her face. Mrs. Maple’s hand was pressed to Perch’s throat, covering a wound. Blood flowed between her fingers.

“Are we okay?” Perch muttered, “Is everyone safe?” Her voice was breathless, weak.

“She was cut in the neck!” Mrs. Maple said, “I’m afraid she’ll bleed out!” Sycamore ran over to the women, kneeling down next to them.

“There’s nothing to be done for Perch,” Granite said with a grim tone, “The blade nicked the artery in her throat. She’ll be dead in moments.” Granite was seated on a rock nearby, rubbing at his temple. On the ground next to him was the corpse of the final bandit; that wicked curved dagger buried in one of his eyes. Sycamore ignored the man, reaching out with his Healer’s Touch. 

As he grew in strength in his soul magic, his Soul Sight had improved. A person’s essence once appeared to him as an indistinct ball of light. Now, he saw a bright sphere of energy, long tendrils looping off of it like loose yarn in a ball. Perch’s soul was weak; it dimmed quickly.

“I don’t want to die,” Perch muttered, “I told my Ma there was no danger in the caravan. We thought we were safe after killing those other bandits. I thought they would pursue us, but Granite said we’d lost them.”

“Move your hand,” Sycamore ordered, hardly listening to what Perch said. Mrs. Maple quickly obeyed, drawing her bloody hand back and wiping it on the ground. Thankfully, there was actually not much damage to Perch’s neck, a small but deep cut that would not be taxing to heal. Sycamore placed his fingertips atop the cut, ignoring the way the blood came out in spurts with Perch’s heartbeat. Cool routine of hundreds of healings took over, denying him the freedom to panic.

“Let her die in peace!” Granite called, “fussing over her will just upset her passing. You’ll only bring her pain.”

“I’m not going to die, am I?” Perch pleaded. “It must be some punishment for leaving the others. That’s why the bandits found us, why they continue to hound us.”

“No, you’re not going to die,” Sycamore said confidently as he pulled on Perch’s soul, guiding a tendril of light to heal the wound. The woman inhaled sharply, releasing a loud yelp as the strange sensation of the healing took over, Sycamore watched as the wound closed, carefully checking that he did not draw too much energy from her essence. After a moment, the healing was finished, and Perch coughed roughly. 

Suddenly, Granite slammed into Sycamore, throwing him away from Perch. The larger man pinned him to the ground with a knee on his chest and a hand on his shoulder. 

“I told you to leave her be. Is it not enough that she’s to die here, so far from her home? Must you bring her undue pain in death?” The impact knocked the breath from Sycamore’s lungs, and he hacked out a cough as he struggled to regain it to explain himself.

Mrs. Maple let out a cry of protest, but Granite was too possessed with anger to notice. “We’re comrades in arms now, and I hate to harm you, boy, but you should give the dead their peace.” 

Sycamore sputtered, trying desperately to offer an explanation, but the pressure on his chest denied any attempt at breathing.

Hands grabbed at Granite’s shoulders, yanking him off of Sycamore. Pike and Lupin tugged at the man, pulling him away as he struggled in their grip.

“Get your hands off of Sycamore!” Lupin yelled, “He’s done nothing to earn your ire.” The gash across his face cast his already strong features in a grim rictus.

“He harasses Perch in her last moments!” Granite said angrily, “Poking and prodding at her wounds causing needless suffering.”

“Calm yourself, man!” Pike said, “Sycamore saved Perch, he didn’t harm her!”

“That’s impossible. I saw the wound, there’s no recovering from that,” Granite growled, grief mixing with his anger. “You boys are young, but I’ve seen many mortal wounds. Perch’s is as dire as they come.”

Sycamore propped himself on an elbow, taking painful breaths. “Have a look for yourself, if you’re so sure,” He finally managed in a frustrated tone, pointing at the woman. Concern for a friend was one thing, but Sycamore had lost enough skin to rough ground that he was tired of being tossed around.

Granite glared at Sycamore briefly before turning to Perch. His jaw fell open in a shocked expression when he saw that she had sat up. Mrs. Maple was holding her steady as she rubbed the blood off the newly closed wound. Disbelief showed on her face, and tears streamed out of her eyes.

Granite looked back and forth between Sycamore and Perch, eyes slowly widening. He mouthed some words, but no sound came out. 

Marrow, still sitting cradling his broken arm as he looked on, spat out a dark mutter. “Damned Westfolk witchery.”

-----

“So you are capable of healing even mortal wounds?” Granite asked. He’d watched as Sycamore slowly worked through each person’s injuries, healing those that needed it. The worst, by far, was Marrow’s arm. The bone was in several pieces, and Sycamore could not heal it fully without risking killing the old man. Still, a rare expression of gratefulness showed on Marrow’s face as he carefully moved his hand, testing the limits of the barely healed bones.

“Yes,” Sycamore said exhaustedly. Healing, in general, was far more taxing on the person being healed than the healer, but given Sycamores weariness from the fight, he felt especially drained after repairing everyone’s wounds.

“Then what’s to stop you from fighting as a mad man, sealing your wounds as they come, continuing endlessly until your last foe is dead?” 

Sycamore blinked. That was a grim picture, and the thought of it tumbled his stomach. “Many things,” He replied. “Firstly, just because I can heal a wound does not prevent them from causing pain. I don’t expect myself to handle such pain, even in the heat of battle.”

“You’d be surprised how little you feel when things get truly desperate,” Granite said.

Sycamore ignored him, continuing, “Secondly, I cannot heal myself. It’s a taboo, and one I’m not eager to test. My mother drove the warning into my skull enough that I’d likely rather die than attempt it.” He winced as he remembered his torn up shoulder, raw from wrestling on the ground. The wound wasn’t bad, but it would ache for days. He wished his mother was here to heal it. But then, were his mother around, he’d not be fighting for his life on what felt like a daily basis.

“And thirdly, healing drains your essence. To have large wounds healed in succession would kill you, or at least drive you into an endless slumber. Which is why I could not heal Marrow fully, too much risk, especially for one as old as him.” Sycamore used a piece of cloth, cut from the sleeve of one of the bandits and soaked in water, to scrub off the blood from his hands. It felt wrong, to use a dead man’s possessions like this, but leaving dried blood on his hands would make him sick to his stomach.

“Then can you heal things like tiredness, or illness?” Perch asked. She’d recovered her wits eventually, offering Sycamore endless thanks and promising to pay him back somehow. He shrugged it off, awkwardly. The Heartwood clan was used to his healing and did not react with such fervor when he fixed them up. It made him uncomfortable, reminded him of his mother’s recollections of her past.

“Perhaps my mother could, but compared to her I’m inexperienced,” He cast the now bloody rag to the side, piling it with the other soiled clothes.

Granite spoke again, “then your mother, is she-”

“Enough questions!” Sycamore said with more bite than he intended, “I’ll be happy to answer them later, but for now, I believe you owe us an explanation.”

Granite paused, conflict clouding his expression. He worked his jaw for a moment before responding. “I can’t say I gather your meaning.”

Sycamore frowned tightly. “While Perch was bleeding out, she spoke of being pursued by bandits. Did you not think to warn us that by travelling with you we might be inviting danger?”

“You cannot take the words of a dying woman on their face, son,” Granite said with a defensive tone.

“Perhaps not,” Sycamore said, “But even as they entered the camp, that bandit passed by Lupin, only stopping at you.”

Granite hesitated a moment before responding, “That means nothing.”

Sycamore let out an exasperated sigh. “Have we not earned even a bit of trust? Secrets, I understand, but if they threaten us, we have the right to know.”

“Those bandits have been following us for days,” Marrow said.

“Marrow, you-” Granite started.

“Enough, man. They saved Perch’s life, and without the Westfolk brat my arm would likely as not be crippled,” Marrow rubbed at his recently healed wrist, flexing his fist, “I’d never say I trust one of those damned silkhairs, but we ought to answer their questions.”

“Fine,” Granite said, “But if we’re branded oathbreakers, it will be on account of your honor.” He turned towards Sycamore. “The caravan we were a part of, it was raided, as we said, by the Fireglass. About twenty of them came upon us, taking the merchants prisoner and confiscating out goods. The three of us managed to get away. About a day later these bandits confronted us. They didn’t expect a fight out of three travelers, so we were able to kill a pair and make our escape. These five harried us in our flight, but I thought we’d lost them about a day before we ran into you all. You can see I was mistaken.” His tone was neutral, not apologetic, but he at least had the decency to look abashed at that last statement.

Sycamore gave him a confused look. “I don’t understand why you would conceal that from us. Some warning would have done nothing but help us be better prepared.”

Granite laughed sardonically. “You hardly agreed to offer us some soup. I couldn’t very well tell you that bandits pursued us seeking revenge.”

That reasoning Sycamore supposed he could understand. However, his indignation pushed back against his understanding. “We have children with us, elderly. We offered you trust. The least you could have returned was proper warning. If the wind had blown in a slightly different direction, we could have died!”

Granite looked to the side, avoiding eye contact.

“If Granite won’t apologize, then I will,” Perch said, “We feared retribution if all details come to the forefront, but those fears should not have driven us so far to secrecy.”

“What punishment would there be for defending yourself from some bandits?” Pike asked. He and Lupin had just returned from piling the bodies in a ditch outside of their camp. They would not go so far as to bury them, but to leave them in the open felt wrong.

“What Granite here failed to mention is that we were on contract as guards for the caravan. There were seven of us, all told. We could have fought the Fireglass, despite the numbers. Four stayed. Three ran,” Marrow said. 

“So you’re cowards,” Lupin said, scowling.

“Easy to accuse of cowardice when you’re not outnumbered two to one by soldiers with better equipment and training,” Marrow replied.

“I faced down a hundred of the Fireglass, swinging my sword until I couldn’t anymore,” Lupin said with a sneer.

“And were you able to save your village?” Marrow said, mirthlessly smiling back. Sycamore recalled when he found lupin, nearly dead on the ground.

“No,” Lupin replied, undaunted, “But at least my honor remains intact.”

“I’ve known many honorable soldiers,” Marrow said, “Most ended up dead, the sharp end of their honor separating head from neck.”

“Cowardice becomes easy when you dress it in practicality,” Lupin said with a snort. Marrow scowled back.

“Enough of the banter,” Granite said with a huff, “The sun rises and Whitebrook awaits. You know our story now, can we put it behind us?”

Sycamore paused a long moment, sharing a look with Pike and Lupin. Pike shrugged back at him; he was always quick to forgive. Lupin took a moment longer, but finally spat to the side and nodded.

“Fine, we’ll accept your explanation,” Sycamore said, rising to his feet and dusting off his pants, “But I expect you to be the one to explain to Mrs. Maple why you put her family in danger.”
