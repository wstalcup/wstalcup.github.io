_As we drew nearer to the Kingdoms, we began to plan for our return. It was a long way to the capital, where my companion’s family resided. With my circumstances, we had to travel softly and covertly; to keep too strict a schedule would be impossible. I apologized to the boy for that, but he shrugged the apology off, saying that unless life was on the line, he did not have a care for the specifics of a plan._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

Dozens of opportunities for failure danced in Sycamore’s mind as they made their silent approach. What if Jackdaw had already been killed – what if they killed him upon their arrival? What if the rest of the Heartwood, disheartened by the first failed revolt, refused to budge and fight for their freedom? What if they were not strong enough to defeat the Fireglass, what if he lacked the strength to hold back the Cinderwhip? They’d come so far, worked so hard that the possibility of failure haunted him, a specter he wanted to deny but could not. He shook his head in a quick motion, casting off his fears before he could become too lost in them. Such thoughts would not help him here, not when they had no choice but to move or let his brother die. Clearing his mind, he instead focused on the prison camp as they drew near.

A rough palisade surrounded the skeleton of an old mining village. The log wall was hastily constructed, built, according to Lotus, by the Heartwood prisoners themselves upon their arrival. It wrapped around the village, a shell that closed it into the mountain where iron mines had been carved from the rock. The wall had a gap in the north, guarded by a pair of soldiers. This was their destination.

As they grew close, the group paused. Lupin and Perch set their packs silently on the ground and drew their swords. From where he watched, Sycamore could see the two guards, black silhouettes in the darkness. They were facing into the camp, fearing escape more than attack. Lupin and Perch approached with slow, silent steps. This was the first moment things could go wrong. If one of the guards heard their steps or simply had an urge to look past their shoulder, they would spot the pair on their approach and things would quickly turn foul.

They drew close to the guards, and Sycamore found himself holding his breath. He waited, in fearful expectation, for the cry of alarm, the cry of attack, the sound of their failure, but it didn’t come. Instead, he saw a rush of movement. He was too far to hear the wet sound of steel piercing flesh, but he saw the way their blades moved, the way they guided the limp bodies to the ground. He exhaled; they would not stumble on their first step.

The rest approached as Lupin and Perch dragged the bodies of the guards off to the side, stowing them along the wall outside the camp. There was a sigh of relief, a nod of thanks as Sycamore handed Lupin’s pack to him. He noticed his friend’s hands were shaking, with anxiety or excitement he could not tell. They lingered as a group for a moment by the entrance. This would be the last time they’d be together as five before the violence began in earnest. They’d left Granite off in the woods to rally anyone who came out. No matter what happened, he was to depart at sunrise. Anyone who had not left the camp by then would have to fend for themselves.

A final silent moment of encouragement, and the group split into two. Juniper and Pike were to find the bulk of the Heartwood and start the escape. By Sycamore’s estimation, there were well over five hundred Heartwood prisoners. It would be impossible to get so many out without being noticed, so they would arm who they could. But with the urgency of the assault, they could only carry enough weapons to arm a handful. There would be a fight, and the Heartwood would be on the weaker side of it.

Still, for the moment, that was the concern of Pike and Juniper. Sycamore, Lupin, and Perch started their silent walk to find those who led the previous revolt, free them, and give them weapons. Sycamore hoped they would be in the condition to fight, and if they weren’t – well, one advantage they had over the Fireglass was his healing.

They moved slowly and silently through the village. It was ominously peaceful, the calm before the storm; squat houses surrounded them that Sycamore knew were filled with folk who would, likely as not, be awake in a few moments trying to kill him. 

Lupin led their trio, sword held lightly in his hand, and Perch took up the rear, watching behind them for any sign of other Fireglass guards. They didn’t expect many, but could not allow poor luck to ruin their plan. Pike and Juniper would have the worst of it as they made their way to where the Heartwood were held in a cordoned off part of the village – they’d memorized the map of the village, but would have to dodge the guards themselves.

There was a pause as they came up behind a shed. It was a wide, windowless stone building, its roof collapsed in from disrepair. Lupin looked over his shoulder and Sycamore nodded – by Juniper’s report this was where the prisoners were held. Sycamore swallowed as they slowly wrapped around it. They expected guards, and it would not be so easy to ambush these as those by the gate. He felt the skin of his arms rise in gooseflesh, from anticipation and the cold wind that blew at his neck. With a breath, he reached out, feeling the flow of that wind, taking control of it. He felt the emotion of the wind, its leisure warring with his own nerves. He leaned into that feeling, allowing its chaotic peace to calm him. Perch moved around him as Lupin peered around the corner of the building in a hesitant movement. After a moment, he held up two fingers – two guards then, as before. Sycamore pulled his own sword from its sheath, twirling his fingers on his other hand, plucking threads of wind out from the current to use as he needed.

A moment more for Lupin to right his grip on his sword, and he surged around the corner. Perch followed, Sycamore on her heels, and there was a grunt of exertion and the crunch of metal on bone. With the wind at his fingertips, he burst around the corner to see Lupin, sword buried under the armpit of one of the Guards. He was shaking his sword, trying to dislodge it and scattering blood about, but it was stuck on something in the guard’s mangled chest. Perch moved at a dash to try to take the other before he could raise the alarm, but Sycamore could tell she would be too late. In the starlight, it was difficult to see the guard’s features; his hands were scrambling to get a better grip on the spear clutched in his grip, his eyes were widened with shock, and his mouth opened wide, to shout for help. Sycamore felt it through the wind, the gasp for air that would bring the enemy down on them.

With a whip of his wrist, Sycamore shoved his threads of wind down the man’s throat before he could shout; it was a precise movement, yarn through the eye of the needle. The man choked on his own breath, coughing roughly, interrupting any attempt at a cry for help. He sputtered a moment more, opening his mouth to call again, but it was too late, and Perch came at him with rapid strikes. He managed to block the first two swings, but with a stab, she cut deeply into his neck, severing the artery and sending a spurt of blood into the air as he collapsed to the ground, vainly gasping for breath through a broken throat. Another quick movement and she ended his suffering, severing his head with a hasty swing of her sword.

“Were we heard?” Lupin whispered, finally freeing his blade as it pulled free with a sucking sound.

“Impossible to say,” Perch said softly, frowning down at the dead guard’s severed head. She turned to Sycamore, “The coughing – was it you?” He nodded and she breathed a sigh, “You’ve given us time then.”

“Come on,” Sycamore added, releasing the wind, “We don’t know how long Pike and Juniper can keep things quiet, and my backpack weighs heavily.”

Lupin nodded, turning to the shed and pushing open the door – there was no lock on the door, and it opened with the groan of rusty hinges. The trio stepped inside, and Sycamore dropped his heavy bag, swinging his arm to stretch his shoulder where it ached from the burden.

His eyes were slow to adjust to the deeper darkness of the room, but he recognized familiar faces scattered about. Lupin’s father, Rhubarb was there, as was Mr. Swift, Mrs. Maple’s husband. A frown pulled down his face when he could not find Jackdaw among the prisoners. One of the prisoners, however, surprised him. He was the only one in the shed awake, watching them enter with wide eyes, smiling brightly.

“Now there’s a pleasant surprise to brighten the night!” Trout said.

-----

The prisoners were slow to awake, weariness tugging at them as they drowsily processed the trio’s presence. Trout was the first on his feet, slapping Sycamore on the back and asking a flurry of questions before Sycamore urged him to quiet.

“My brother,” Trout finally asked, eagerness in his voice, “Is he with you?”

“He and Juniper are rallying the rest of the Heartwood for your escape,” Sycamore replied, “I think he expected to find you there; it was part of the reason we sent him that way.”

Trout grinned at him. “Come now, Sprout. Did you truly expect me to miss out on such excitement? They could not have convinced me not to join in a reckless rebellion attempt – though it seems you have us outdone at that.” 

Sycamore grinned at his friend, happy to see him in good spirits, even here and now. “Reckless or desperate or heroic, we’re going to need all hands to pull this off,” He kicked at the bag of weapons on the ground, “I’ve brought steel.”

Trout’s grin took on a wicked look as he hunched over the bag to pick out his weapon of choice. Sycamore frowned over his friend’s back. He was in good spirits, but there was a weakness about him, a shakiness that spoke of the trouble’s his clan had endured thus far. He prayed this would be the last night of such hardships.

The others slowly pulled themselves from sleep, and Sycamore saw Rhubarb’s eyes widen as he slowly recognized Lupin.

“Good to see you, Father,” Lupin said with a lopsided grin.

There was a scramble of movement and soft thud as Rhubarb jumped to his feet and slammed Lupin with a bone-crushing hug. Tears were at the corner of the big man’s eyes, and he was shaking silently as he held back sobs.

“My boy,” He whispered, “My son. I thought I’d lost you.” 

Lupin returned the hug for a tender moment before urgency overtook him and he spoke in a soft voice, “Enough of the emotion, father, we’ll have time for that later. There’s much to do if the clan is to be free tonight.”

Slowly, Rhubarb pulled out of the hug, grasping Lupin by the shoulders at an arm’s length. “A moment to look,” he said, his voice gravelly with emotion. With a nod and a huff of breath, he released his son, wiping the tears from his eyes. “Now, what is the plan?”

“Sprout has brought weapons,” Trout said brightly, pulling a short sword from Sycamore’s bag.

Rhubarb’s eyes shifted to Sycamore, “Where did you get steel?”

“Later,” Lupin said, “For now, rouse everyone and get something sharp in their hands. Pike and Juniper will have hopefully convinced the others to make haste in our escape, but the Fireglass are going to notice quick enough. We need to be over there to lead and defend.”

“We could not convince Aunt Poppy to move with our revolt, what makes you think she’ll listen this time?” Trout asked as he brought the bag from prisoner to prisoner. There were only a handful of men in the shed; Lotus had not lied when he said it was only a small group involved in the fight.

Lupin shrugged, “Sycamore said he was certain she would change her mind.” He turned to Sycamore with a questioning look.

Sycamore smiled, “They planned to execute my brother in the morning. My mother abhors violence, but do you truly believe she would allow anyone who threatens her family to walk away without a proper thrashing?”

There was a pause as they considered, and Rhubarb nodded, “And where the Storm Priestess leads, the rest will follow. It’s sound.”

“Speaking of Jackdaw,” Sycamore added, “Where is my brother?”

The prisoners shared a look, but ultimately Rhubarb shook his head, “We don’t know. They took him somewhere, to hold separately. He took responsibility for the attempt, claimed he forced us into it.”

“It wasn’t right, to let him, I’m sorry Sycamore,” Swift said.

Sycamore turned to the man, waving his hand, “No need for apology. Jackdaw was head, and he probably believes it to be only his responsibility. I have little doubt you’d all have said the same things if you were in his position.” Looking at Swift, his eyes widened as he remembered something. “Your wife and kids are safe, Swift. They’re in Whitebrook, among friends. Mrs. Maple told me to inform you that you owe her for months of taking care of them alone, once we get back.”

“Once we get back,” He replied softly, nodding with a wide smile on his face.

When the rest were armed, Perch spoke up, “We need to move quickly if we’re to find your brother before things get too heated, Sycamore.”

“By the way, who is this?” Trout asked suddenly, looking at Perch with curious eyes.

Sycamore blinked. He’d forgotten that they’d never met the woman. “My name is Perch,” She answered easily, “I owe Sycamore my life.” Immediately Trout nodded, as if that was explanation enough.

Her explanation reminded him of something, “Are any of you injured?” he asked, scanning the prisoners about.

“No,” Rhubarb said, “your mother strong-armed her way into healing us after our failed revolt. Your brother, though…” His voice trailed off.

“It’s bad, Sprout,” Trout finished, “The Cinderwhip did not treat him kindly.”

“All the more reason to be quick to find him,” Sycamore said, “Come now, let’s move.”

“What of the guards?” Swift asked.

“Dead,” Lupin said, “From here, we need you all to join the others, keep them safe. Sycamore, Perch, and I will go to find Jackdaw. You know the camp better than us, I assume you can find your way to them.”

“Absolutely not,” Rhubarb said, “I’m not leaving you, Lupin. Not again.”

Lupin shook his head as he spoke, “This is different than at the forge, Father. I was reckless then. We have a plan now, and for it to succeed we need you to join the others and fight. Show them the fangs of the Heartwood clan.” He grinned at the last, a fierce, defiant smile. 

Father and son stared at each other for a long moment before Lupin nodded in a slow, pained motion. “Fine,” He said, “I’ll trust your plan. Now let’s go before I change my mind.” He hugged Lupin once more before they moved to leave the prison shed.

They stepped over the corpses of the guards, and the one-time prisoners started their walk towards the rest of the Heartwood. As he passed Sycamore, Trout gave him another slap on the shoulder.

“Luck, Sprout,” he whispered with a smile, “Looking forward to swapping stories when this is all done.”

“Find your brother, keep an eye on him” Sycamore replied with a nod.

When the trio of Perch, Sycamore, and Lupin was again alone, Lupin spoke, “how are we to find Jackdaw, then? I imagine going from door to door is not the soundest idea.”

“We could look for guards, like they had on this shed,” Perch suggested. Sycamore frowned in thought. It was a sound enough idea, but there was a risk if they were spotted before they found Jackdaw. He had a hunch it wouldn’t be long before the violence truly began, but the longer they delayed that, the better. So far they had done a good job, but it would be a slow process to find Jackdaw, unless they had some way of seeing him that wasn’t searching through each house.

Sycamore’s eyes widened as a thought occurred to him. _Have you ever used your Soul Sight to search for someone from a distance?_

The Magus replied quickly, _Personally, no, but it’s a common enough skill for those soul mages more inclined to combat._ He had been silent so far to give Sycamore a chance to focus, but there was excitement and nerves in his voice to match Sycamore’s own feelings.

Sycamore nodded to himself. “I have an idea,” he said, “But I have no guarantee it’ll work.”

“What is it, then?” Perch asked.

“A moment,” He replied. He shut his eyes to focus, casting out his Healer’s Touch in a wide net. It was a different feeling from normal, a spider web of perception instead of the usual focused probe. His soul magic had grown greatly since the last time he had used this ability, when he first found the Magus’s sanctum. Even so, it was a strain to spread the net, slowly weave it as he stretched it around him. Souls began to appear around him, bright stars in the spaceless void of his Soul Sight. First was his own, then Perch and Lupin, and soon dozens of shining orbs built a constellation of individuals around him. They were clustered mostly, groups of Fireglass soldiers asleep in houses. He felt the strain on his power as he stretched it further, searching for the anomaly.

“There,” He said with a strained voice, marking the spot in his memory and releasing the ability.

“Follow me,” He said to the others. 

Lupin gave him a confused look, “You found him? How?”

“It’s – difficult to explain,” He said, stopping himself before he even tried, “But I think I can guide us to him.” There’d been a lone, isolated soul, separate from the rest.

“I trust you. Lead the way,” Lupin replied, and Perch nodded.

_What did you see?_ The Magus asked.

_An isolated soul, not in a group like the rest.¬_

_It could be the Cinderwhip. I doubt she shares lodging with her underlings._

Sycamore gritted his teeth at the mention of the enemy commander. _The soul was weak._ It was another debt he owed the woman, whatever she had done to Jackdaw. He avoided imagining the state of his brother as he set off, weaving around the houses with silent steps, leading Perch and Lupin to Jackdaw.

“There should be one guard,” Sycamore said as he drew close, “Kill them quickly, we need to move fast.” His voice sounded cold, even to his own ears. He felt renewed urgency, seeing Jackdaw’s soul and hearing Trout’s description of his state.

As they drew close, Sycamore extended a finger, pointing to where a Fireglass guard stood crouched, drawing patterns in the dirt with a stick. Lupin and Perch slunk ahead, moving quietly to ambush the guard before he could react.

Suddenly, there was a shout in the night from the direction of the rest of the Heartwood. Sycamore clicked his tongue as Jackdaw’s guard looked up from the dirt, eyes widening as he saw Lupin and Perch. They were on him with their swords in a moment, but not before he let out a startled yelp. It was cut off as Perch’s sword took him in the stomach and Lupin’s crashed through his head, but the noise still cut through the night. From the other side of the camp, too, shouts continued, more and more voices upsetting the quiet.

Sycamore’s heart slammed in his chest. He knew, from his Soul Sight, how many Fireglass soldiers were around here, and with the guard’s shout they only had moments before this area would be a swarm of activity.

He dashed over to the prison, turning to Lupin, “Quiet’s over. Watch the door.” Lupin nodded swiftly, and Sycamore pushed into the small shed where they’d stuck Jackdaw, Perch following behind him.

His brother was there, sprawled on the ground, but Sycamore hardly recognized him through the burns. Half of his body was a mess of blisters and burnt skin, and the air reeked of pus and blood. Sycamore tasted bile, from the smell and the surge of anger he felt seeing his brother in this state.

With quick steps, he knelt next to Jackdaw, reaching out with his Healer’s Touch. His soul was weak now, weak enough that Sycamore could not heal him completely. A moment of careful consideration and he began to heal, breathing a sigh of relief as much of the blistering skin settled itself and Jackdaw began to look whole.

“Mother?” His brother’s voice slurred from the ground, recognizing the sensation of the healing. His eyes widened as he saw Sycamore.

“Is this a dream? A vision before I die?” He asked, his voice unnaturally calm.

Sycamore stopped his healing, fearing to repeat the mistake of Mastiff. “If that were the case,” He said, “I wouldn’t stop healing you halfway. Up now, brother, It’s time to be out of this wretched place.”

Jackdaw spoke in a hushed voice as Perch helped him to his feet, “I don’t understand – how are you here? What is going on? Where are the guards?” 

“The guards are dead, and we’re here to free our clan. As for how I got here – That’s a longer story, for a more peaceful time. Come on, we have to move.”

“Wait Sycamore,” Jackdaw said, grabbing Sycamore by the shoulder. He turned to face his brother. It was hard to look at him – he was haggard, weak, still half burnt. Still, he was alive, and Sycamore felt a joy at the reunion, only suppressed by the urgency of the moment.

“It’s good to see you,” Jackdaw finally said. Sycamore nodded, and they moved to leave the shed. They stepped out in the darkness, and Jackaw’s eyes widened when he saw the corpse on the ground. He looked up at Sycamore, “By the sun and the stars, what have you been driven to?” Sycamore ignored him, nodding thanks to Lupin as he turned to look at them. Lupin frowned at the sight of Jackdaw, muttering a string of oaths under his breath.

“I’d expected Pike, but Lupin? We thought you dead! Your father, did you-”

“He’s moved with the others,” Sycamore said, cutting off Jackdaw, “Pike is with them too, to gather the rest of the Heartwood for our escape.” He paused to listen. “From the sound of it, we’ve been found out.” The volume of the night had increased, and torches had started to go up around the camp. A few soldiers were hustling towards the noise, pushing out of where they had slept as they hastily pulled on armor. They had not yet been noticed, but Sycamore did not expect that to last.

“We need to get to the others,” Lupin said, his sword nervously swaying in his hand, “We’ll be surrounded here.”

“Then let’s move,” Sycamore said. He turned to Perch, looking from her to Jackdaw, who leaned against her shoulder for support.

“When we get to the others, I need you to take my brother and lead him to Granite. I expect the first members of the Heartwood will be arriving at his spot soon, and he’ll need someone familiar to organize them. Jackdaw’s the head, he can handle that.”

“You can’t expect me to-” Jackdaw started at the same time Perch said, “I’m not leaving before-”

“Enough!” Sycamore snapped, “Jackdaw, you’re clearly in no condition to fight, and Perch, push past your foolish pride and remember our goal. Protect my brother.” The last was a plea more than an order, eventually both nodded.

They started to move and Sycamore spoke, “Lupin, take the lead, but remember our goal is to push through, not kill them. I’ll cover the sides and rear.”

“You’ll cover us,” Jackdaw said, exasperated, “How?”

Sycamore gritted his teeth, grasping the wind as a mirthless grin formed on his face, “With what you taught me.”
