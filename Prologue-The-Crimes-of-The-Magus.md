Fire crashed against the walls of the keep, flashes of pain on the edge of the Magus’s awareness. The sound and shock of the blast was muted in his workshop sequestered deep in the earth. He muttered calculations to himself as he frantically scribbled down his final volume of notes, hoping, praying that some of his work would be spared for posterity. Another fireball crashed against the limestone, larger than the last, and he winced as bits of stone rained from above. He could not see their forces, but he knew he was surrounded in his keep, his prison, his body. Fifteen years in peaceful exile undone by a mouthy apprentice. He hoped the trio wouldn’t hang for this, but he knew the Peacekeepers did not look kindly on this type of research. He’d sent them off this morning with advice to deny any involvement with his studies. He regretted, briefly, taking in the three orphans, but it was a fleeting feeling. Had he known the day he came upon them that one of those starving wretches would be his undoing, he still would have opened his doors for them. He was not in the business of watching children starve. 

A final sentence written and he signed the last page, autographing his death sentence. He closed the volume and bound it tightly in leather, placing it on the shelf next to the others. There was an effort of preservation magic on the library, enough that the tomes would last for decades without degrading. He hoped that was long enough for someone worthy to find this place, continue his research. A moment of uncertainty assaulted him – had it been worth it? Eschewing nobility, betraying his father’s hopes, tampering with his soul, committing treason? Another flash of pain as the legion of mages threw spells at his defenses, and he shook off the feeling. It was much too late for doubt.

He spared one final look for his library, years of research and collection, before turning to leave. He sealed the door behind him and cast a thought to the balcony connected to his bedroom, many floors above. He collected himself, and, with an effort of will, suddenly stood in the bedroom. So deep was his connection to his keep that even space itself was putty in his hands. At the top of the tower, the chaos of the assault was far more apparent. The bedroom, seldom used, was in chaos. His dresser had toppled, scattering his garments about. Ash from a downed lamp was scattered on his bedding, soiling the fine silken sheets. Dust and bits of stone hovered about. He could hear the yelling of the mage corps outside, the shrieks of fireballs thrown through the air, buffeting his defenses. He slowly walked towards the balcony, mentally preparing to welcome his aggressors. He stumbled as another spell crashed into his keep, this time a blast of lightning. Goosebumps flared on his arms and the stone beneath his feet groaned in protest at the treatment. In other circumstances, he might worry for the stability of the tower, but his connection to this place let him feel that the stone would hold true for as long as he would have to worry about it. He smiled in simple appreciation towards the masons who had built the keep; their work was quality, despite the duplicitous nature of their client. 

He threw open the balcony door and stepped into the midmorning light. He winced at the sunlight, and had a dull realization that he hadn’t left his keep in weeks. The air was warm and smelled strongly of ash and lightning. His keep was perched on top of a small hill, and his balcony afforded him a pleasant view out onto the plains. He briefly regretted that he hadn’t appreciated it enough. When he emerged onto the balcony, a call of cease-fire went up from the assaulting forces, dozens of mages lined around his hill, guarded by at least a hundred foot. Despite himself, he grinned at that. The Peacekeepers were paranoid, he knew, but to bring so many to attack him was to paint him as an archmage instead of the simple scholar he was. There was a pause as the attackers waited for him to address them. When he said nothing, a single man stepped out from the group of attackers. He was a tall man with stark grey hair and the weathered skin decades of soldiering brought. He slowly approached the tower, staring up at the Magus before simply leaping into the air, far higher than was possible without magic, and landing next to the Magus.

“General,” The Magus said.

“Sir Magus,” The General replied. He wore the gaudy armor of His Magesty’s Peacekeeping Union, lacquered in purple and gold. A silver rabbit was stamped out on his chest, his family crest.

“I’m afraid I don’t have the facility to accommodate such numbers, especially without notice,” The Magus said. They both knew how this would end, but some theater was necessary to preserve pride. “If you would like, I could ask my servants to set up some tents for you.”

“We both know you sent your servants away weeks ago,” The general replied gruffly. The Magus had never known him to be anything but gruff.

“Then I would ask you to leave,” The Magus said, “else I risk embarrassing myself as a host unable to accommodate his guests.”

“I’m afraid I cannot, with what you stand accused of.”

“With such accusations, is it right to even be speaking to me?”

The general frowned, “Consider it a courtesy from an old friend.” The two had been close, once, long ago. “I have an offer from His Majesty, and I suggest you take it.”

“His Majesty’s good will extends further than I dared hope.”

“Not his Majesty, but his Majesty’s aunt.” A pang of regret and guilt surged in the Magus, old feelings.

There was a long pause before the Magus responded, “The offer?”

“Admit your guilt, peacefully turn over your research materials, and live out the rest of your days under house arrest in the capital, where someone can keep an eye on you.” It was a generous offer, far more so than his crimes deserved. Unfortunate.

“I’m afraid I must decline,” The Magus said. 

“But why?” The general said with uncharacteristic surprise, “Do not let your pride damn you to an untimely death!”

“Pride would be one thing, but I’ve already damned myself. I can no longer leave this place.” 

The surprise on the general’s face slowly morphed to understanding. “It’s true then, that you’ve bound your soul? Anchored yourself to the mortal realm?” He looked at the Magus’s keep, the Magus’s vessel, with dull horror, “I thought it exaggeration. Is the rest of it true? Tampering with the souls of others? Heretical research? Perversion of the soul?”

“You know the crimes I stand accused of.”

Over a long moment, the Magus saw years of friendship warring with duty on the General’s face. Duty prevailed.

“With this new information, I have no choice but to rescind the former offer. For sins against the soul, you are hereby sentenced to death. Considering you have bound your soul to this keep, it will be razed to rubble until your soul is free from this prison. I pray you find rest in the oblivion, despite your sins.” 

Without another word, the general turned and leapt off the balcony. The Magus felt shame that he had put his old friend in such a position, but he did not regret. His research was necessary for progress, to bring about a revolution. He had failed to achieve such heights, but perhaps off the back of his research, something great would be achieved.

He didn’t flinch when the assault of fire and lightning restarted and his defenses began to crumble. He didn’t flinch as he felt each impact rippling off the stone, sending tremors of pain down his skin. He didn’t even flinch when a ball of plasma, thrown by the general himself, tore a hole through his chest.
