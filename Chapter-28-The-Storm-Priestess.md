_As we drew closer to the border of the Kingdoms, I asked the boy what his purpose for coming west was. I often asked him that question, and each time he seemed to give me a different answer. I thought him a liar at first, but the more I asked, the more I thought he believed in all his reasons. This time, he said he was in pursuit of a dream._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

They burst onto the scene of the fight in a storm of wind. As they made their flight through the prison camp, Lupin knocked aside the gathering groups of Fireglass soldiers enough that they could push past, and Sycamore slapped them with enough air that, by the time they had their senses back, they were long gone.

The armed Heartwood stood in front of the entrance to the area where the clan was imprisoned. There was a fence that separated this part of the village from the rest, not so tall as the palisade but sturdy enough that they could use the gap in the wall as a bottleneck. The Heartwood defenders had formed loose ranks of men and women there, a barrier to the evacuation going on behind them.

When they shoved past the final group of Fireglass, Sycamore spun, leaning into his Speaking for a final squall of wind that pressed the soldiers back enough to protect Jackdaw and Perch as they shuffled behind the front line of defenders. Job done, he spun and, with Lupin, dashed to join his fellow Heartwood. There were a few cheers as they stepped into the line.

Sycamore looked down the row of defenders. All those from the previous revolt had made it; they, with a dozen others armed by Pike and Juniper, stood in two ranks. He spotted Juniper among the second rank, her arrow nocked and a grim expression on her face. Pike and Trout were there, standing shoulder to shoulder next to their Pa. It was good to see them together again. 

He moved to join Jackdaw and Perch as they pushed past the defenders. They were hobbling towards the slow procession of refugees. Following the plan, Pike and Juniper had torn a few logs out of the palisade, creating a wide enough gap for a steady, if slow, evacuation.

“Sycamore,” Jackdaw said, noticing his approach, “Your speaking, it’s – no matter. I’ll delay my questions for now, but I expect answers when we’re out of here.” He had a pained look on his face, and he leaned more into Perch with every step. The rush across the village had been a strain on him, and he needed to rest before he injured himself further.

“I don’t wish to repeat myself, so I’ll tell you and Mother both, when we’re out,” Sycamore said with a small smiled.

Jackdaw nodded, raising a hand to touch a burn on his face, wincing as his fingertips brushed on the blisters. “I’m sorry I can’t help you fight. It’s shameful,” He said, “Apologize to our mother for me. I was reckless, and she was right that I should have been more patient. Any other day and I’d laugh at the irony of injuring myself in revolt not two days before you showed up with a better formed, better equipped plan.”

Sycamore smiled, recalling the strangeness of Jackdaw’s humor. “We’ll laugh at it later, then. Go, lead the Heartwood; you’re our head, and they need your voice.”

“Good luck, brother.”

“Luck, Sycamore,” Perch said, guiding Jackdaw with short steps to join the fleeing Heartwood. Sycamore watched them for a moment more before turning back to the front. He had to trust they’d get out safe and sound, for he had his own battle to fight here.

He moved back to the rows of defender, pushing up next to Trout, Pike, and their pa. He frowned, “Why aren’t they fighting us?” There was a gap between the two forces, and though they yelled taunts at each other, none had moved to start the violence.

“They’re waiting for numbers,” Pike said with a nod of greeting for Sycamore. They only had twenty on their side, and already the Fireglass across the gap outnumbered them.

“Then why do we wait?” Sycamore asked, “Would it not be better to attack now, before they can rally their forces?”

“Our goal isn’t to kill them, but buy time,” the twin’s pa said, “You can sprint halfway or jog to the end, son. Rushing into a fight is counter to our goal.”

“Right,” Sycamore said, nodding at the wisdom of the words. Every moment they delayed here was another that their clan had to carry out their escape. Still, he could not help feeling uneasy, comparing the Heartwood forces to the Fireglass. On the other side stood dozens of soldiers in their red and black armor, yelling taunts and jeers at them, weapons at the ready. And on the Heartwood side, exhausted prisoners, with poor health and unused to wielding weapons in violence. Pike, Lupin, and he were the healthiest of the bunch, but they could not cover the deficiencies of their entire clan. They still had his speaking, but the other side would have the Cinderwhip.

He turned to Pike, “Where is my mother?”

“She’s encouraging the others along,” he replied, “But you were right. When I mentioned their plan to execute Jackdaw, a cold calm took over her. The tone of her words as she demanded an explanation chilled me to the core. When I mentioned you, her eyes – I believe she’ll want to exchange words when she arrives at the front.”

Sycamore swallowed. He did not know how she would react to the rescue mission, whether she would be upset or pleased. And from the looks of things, he did not have the time to worry. The Fireglass had begun to move.

-----

The first arrow was loosed by Juniper, and Sycamore saw it stick into the side of one of the Fireglass, watched him go down in a cry of pain as his comrades swept over him. Sycamore felt his throat tighten up; his palm was sweaty on the grip of his sword. He took a deep, calming breath, reaching for the wind and finding the connection easily. Its power soothed him, bolstered his confidence. 

“Steady, Heartwood,” Rhubarb barked, his deep voice carrying over the yells of the Fireglass charge. As they drew near, Sycamore swung his arm in a wide arc, waiting as he gathered the air into a whip of wind. A step before the forces collided, he snapped his elbow straight, tearing with a gust across the eyes of the Fireglass forces as they readied their weapons to strike. The Heartwood ranks seized this moment, and Sycamore stabbed his sword into the chest of the Fireglass charging towards him. 

Sycamore felt the resistance of the leather armor on his blade, and he clutched the hilt desperately as it pierced through. His eyes obscured by the wind, the soldier could not react, and with the momentum of his charge, he was easily impaled. A shock of force jolted Sycamore’s arm as his sword passed through leather and flesh, grinding through ribs to crash against bone. There was a spray of blood, and Sycamore felt droplets scatter on his face. In front of him, the man slowly blinked the wind out of his eyes, looking down at Sycamore’s blade protruding from his chest. His weapon tumbled from his hands, and Sycamore ignored the look of horror on the soldier’s face as he kicked a foot out, striking him in the stomach and yanking his blade free. He pushed past the sudden wave of nausea that swept over him. There would be time for sickness later, but for now he must fight.

The chaotic symphony of battle surrounded him, screams of pain and violent yells balancing the sounds of bodies crashing into each other, metal scraping off metal, and the wet sounds of bones being crushed and flesh being sliced. It was a blur as he swung his blade and threw wind around, trying to beat back the Fireglass as he avoided every slash and stab they threw at him. He smelled iron and bile, mud and dust, and he could not tell if his face was wet from blood or sweat. He ducked under a slash, stabbing out at the woman. She sidestepped him easily and moved to attack again, but a spear pierced her through the neck. Sycamore didn’t have time to process his gratefulness as he slammed Pike with his shoulder, knocking his friend out of the path of a downward axe swing. Sycamore stomped a foot on the head of the axe, pinning it to the ground as he swung his sword. He missed as the man released his weapon, leaping back to avoid Sycamore’s blade. He spun to find his next target, the next strike to dodge, but there was a moment of peace as the Fireglass pulled back from their charge.

He could feel his heart in his throat, could feel nerves sending his sword shaking in his hand. He spun the wind around him in a spiral, searching for its calming aloofness, but it was harder and harder to find as he processed the scene of the battle in front of him

The Heartwood had come out ahead in the first charge. Nearly two dozen bodies lay scattered on the ground in the aftermath of the first clash, and whether it was Sycamore’s maneuver or good fortune, only five were of the Heartwood. Those five deaths struck him like five swift hammer blows to the heart, and thinned their numbers by a quarter. A few more moved to the back of their ranks, too injured to continue fighting. With a glance, he looked for his friends. Next to him, blood was pouring down Pike’s face, staining his teeth red as he smiled wildly with his spear held confidently in front of him. Trout stood aside him, sword bloody and smiling shakily. Lupin and his father wore the same expression, eyes full of madness over an angry sneer. He forced himself not to look at the bodies of his fallen comrades. He could grieve when it was over. 

He swallowed, tasting iron and grit from blood and sand that had found its way into his mouth. A few more clashes like that and they’d be wiped out to the man. He did not have the freedom to spare a look behind him at his escaping clansmen, but he knew they would not buy enough time, not kill enough to stop Fireglass pursuit.

_She’s here.¬_ The Magus sent grimly.

Sycamore spat in front of him, begging his knees to remain steady as the Fireglass ranks parted and the Cinderwhip, two torches in hand, stepped forward. Her hair was short and tattoos dotted her cheeks and neck. She had a broad nose, and burn scars flecked up and down her limbs. Her torches, she held in her hands like weapons, and the flames extended unnaturally forward, blades of intense heat, flicking the air around him. He could feel the fire, through his connection to the wind, feel the way it twisted the air around it. More than that, it was unnatural, like a spire of rock, disrupting the flow of a river.

It had gone quiet with the arrival of the Cinderwhip, but suddenly there was the twang of a bowstring. With unnatural reflexes, she whipped a torch up, incinerating Juniper’s arrow before it could take her in the neck. Sycamore looked to his friend. Her eyes were wide with shock.

Eyes scanning the Heartwood defenders, the Cinderwhip spoke, “What’s this, then?” Her voice was surprisingly high pitched, smooth and cold, “Again with the attempt to escape? Your Storm Priestess made a deal for peace in exchange for obedience.” Her eyes flicked to the bodies on the ground. “No matter. You’ve broken the deal, and I’ll take the price for killing my men.”

Sycamore felt it in his speaking before he saw it, the flames of the torches extending into long, spindly, flickering whips. They writhed like worms of molten light as she wound up and snapped one forward towards the Heartwood.

On instinct, Sycamore leapt forward, throwing the might of his Speaking into her fire. There was a howl of wind as he felt the fire tear through his power, grunting with exertion and pain as he pushed against the heat, pushed against the fire. Just before the whip crashed into the ranks of defenders, the fire flickered, losing its energy and evaporating into air.

He breathed a sigh of relief, forcing his breath to calm as he rallied his strength, preparing for the next attack.

_That was not her full power,_ The Magus warned.

_I know¬._ He could tell from the way he felt her speaking that she was far more powerful than him. She wound up another attack and again, he desperately defended, barely stopping the whip from crashing down on his friends. A few more barely deflected attacks and he realized she was toying with him, testing the limits of his powers.

Suddenly she smirked, swinging another attack at him, far more powerful than the previous few. With all his might, he pushed forward, desperately trying to block the blow. He could not, though, and it continued to bear down on him like a viper cast of flames. He could feel the heat on his face when a weight slammed in to him, tackling him out of the way of the attack.

“Sun-blinded fool,” Lupin snapped as he scrambled back to his feet, “don’t just let it hit you!”

Sycamore painfully rolled across the ground, pushing himself to his feet when he came to a stop. “Thank you,” He said to Lupin.

“Save it,” He said with a scowl for the Cinderwhip, “We need to stop her. Can you defeat her, if you try again?” She was watching them with an amused expression, a cat over a crippled mouse.

“No,” Sycamore said, “She’s too strong.”

_Sycamore._

_I know._ He was loathe to use it, but it was time for his last resort.

“Lupin,” He said, “I need you to-” His voice cut off and his eyes widened as he felt a mountain of power looming behind him. He turned slowly to see an old woman approaching in a ragged dress, stained brown from dirt and old blood. Her greying hair was in a loose bun. She wore a scowl on her face as she pushed through the Heartwood ranks, her eyes darting from the corpses on the ground to the Cinderwhip. Finally, she looked to Syamore.

“I’ve told you time and time again, my Sapling, not to be reckless. Now move out of the way and let me handle this.”

His mother had arrived.

-----

As he moved to hide behind his mother, Sycamore could not help but feel awe at the sheer power he felt emanating from her. His power was a pebble next to her mountain, a breeze against her hurricane. It was hard to reconcile with the woman from his memories, strict but never violent, powerful in demeanor but loving and affectionate. She looked old now, older than his memories, but he could not do anything but fear the strength he felt. He swallowed, finally understanding the respect the name the Storm Priestess commanded.

“Mother, I-” He started.

“Later, my son. Let me attend these folk first.” With all the calm of a midnight stroll, she stepped forward, coming to a stop between the two armies.

“I heard you injured my older son, and now you attack the younger,” She called, “Are you trying to make me angry?”

“They broke the agreement. Look at the bodies around you.”

“You know, three members of my clan died in their sleep last night,” His mother’s voice was soft, but pierced with accusation.

“I can’t see your point,” The Cinderwhip replied dryly.

“Is it peace, then, to drive us to death?”

“You are the healer. That’s hardly my responsibility.” Sycamore felt a flare of anger on his mother’s behalf. They did not understand how their ability worked, could not fathom the weight she bore.

“Enough,” His mother spat, “You’ve tried my patience long enough. We will be leaving now.”

The Fire Speaker sneered broadly at her, “I’ve been waiting for this. Charge her, men!”

With renewed fervor, the Fireglass troops surged forward. Lupin started to move to her defense, but Sycamore grabbed his shoulder. His friend looked to him with confused eyes, but Sycamore just shook his head. “She does not need our help. We’ll only be in the way.” Slowly, Lupin nodded, turning back to watch the battle unfold.

The Cinderwhip struck with both her fiery weapons, and the rest of the Fireglass, dozens all together, charged at his mother standing alone. Sycamore felt strangely at ease as he watched; it was impossible for him to think her in danger, with the power she wielded. He knew it was not possible, but he thought he heard his mother sigh as the threats drew near.

Suddenly, Sycamore could hear nothing but the roar of wind. The fire of the whips was brushed aside, and the enemy forces were pushed back on their heels. With a flick of her wrist, three soldiers were shot straight up into the air like flower petals in an updraft. A moment later they crashed to the ground. Bones poked through skin as they fractured jaggedly, and blood was swept up by the incomprehensible windstorm.

Sycamore could hardly keep his eyes open as he watched in mute horror. He wondered, desperately, how his mother could have allowed them to be captured. Lupin had once said that she could have faced down two hundred alone, and now Sycamore understood. But still, watching her toy with the enemy like a child playing in a pile of leaves, he felt her pain. The screams of terror and horror were drowned out by roar of the storm, the crushing weight of their deaths hitting harder than any enemy could. He could feel it, in her Speaking and with his connection to his mother. She was sorrowful; this pained her. He knew, if he could see her face, she would be weeping.

But still, he could not be unhappy. Her horror, her pain, her sorrow, it meant that they would win the day and be free from the Fireglass. There were questions of the worth of these things, questions that formed his mother’s ideology after decades steeped in violence, that drove them to the west, but they were questions they could discuss when they had won. He felt himself smiling, sorrowful and joyful, at his mother’s pain and his clan’s freedom. His smile was short lived.

One moment the wind howled, and the next it went silent. Sycamore’s ears could not adjust, but he still heard the sound, felt it through his Speaking. His mother choked as she inhaled. Sycamore’s eyes widened as he stared. A sword, probably thrown in desperation or simply picked up by the wind, had somehow found its way carried on the current to bury itself in her side. For a moment, she staggered on her feet. And then, she collapsed.

There was a pause in mute shock as all processed what they saw. As soon as he regained himself, Sycamore reached out with his Soul Sight. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw she yet lived, her soul flickering but whole. He was not the only one to see this though, and the Cinderwhip stepped forward, wild, gleeful grin on her face. He needed to heal his mother, but first he had to deal with the Cinderwhip.

He spun to Lupin, who was kneeling, staring at his mother with wide eyes. “Lupin,” He cried desperately, “I need you to trust me.”

Slow to process, Lupin turned to him, pausing a moment before nodding, “Of course, Sycamore, but what-”

_Stop me before I drain him dry._

_Even if you have not defeated the Cinderwhip?_

Sycamore hesitated a long moment before answering, _Even then. My mother would never forgive me if I killed another to save her.¬_

He stuck a hand out, seizing Lupin by the wrist. He’d kept his connection to the wind, but now he reached out with his Healer’s Touch. Lupin had taken no significant injury in the battle, his soul shined with light. There was power to work with.

He pulled on Lupin’s soul. When he healed, he guided it to an injury, but this time, he pulled it further, into his own body. He felt a shock, a jolt of power as the energy from Lupin’s essence trickled down Sycamore’s arm to his core. He searched for the overlap in power, for his connection to the wind. This was his first time attempting it, and it took a moment before he found it, that thrum of power that was his Speaking. Preparing himself with a deep breath, he drew the energy of Lupin’s soul into that connection. There was an overflow of power, and he felt his consciousness dissolve into the wind.

They’d thought of it on their way from the Magus’s sanctum, a way for his two strengths to complement each other. Conventionally, souls could be used to power magic, but usually this damaged the soul, often killing the person. Sycamore’s method of healing, however, was indirect, safe for the target. The Magus hypothesized Sycamore could use this, pull power from another to strengthen his Speaking beyond anything he could otherwise achieve. Sycamore was worried though, fearing for his control and the risks to the person whose soul he used. Those fears were moot, now, as the time to use this last resort had come.

In his mind, Sycamore had become the wind. He felt himself smiling leisurely as he felt the endless currents of air around him, carrying high into the heavens and far across the land. His purpose scrabbled for a hold in his mind, and it suddenly clicked when he saw the flash of red in front of him, the lines of fire burning towards his mother.

With an aloof movement, he flicked a finger, and the wind moved to obey. He was so immersed he could not hear the howl of the wind, but he felt the gale tear at his skin, snuff the torches of the Cinderwhip out like embers in a storm. She rallied again with more power, lashing out into his wind, but he could almost laugh. He stepped forward smacking aside her flames and pressing her back. There was some reason, he felt, for him to win the fight urgently, but he was the wind, he could not be rushed or corralled. He did what he liked, and the world bent for him. Around him, he saw the other Fireglass moving to attack his clan. Instinct warned him not to let that happen, and he pressed them back with a simple wave of his hand. Below him, he saw a flinch of movement, a slowly widening pool of blood.

_Sycamore, his soul!_

Understanding returned as he saw his mother’s blood, and he lashed out again with his power, pressing harder on the Cinderwhip. He’d wasted time, wasted power.

_You pull too much!_

_No!_ He could not stop yet, not until the Cinderwhip was dead. He still felt her power, vainly pressing against his own, too weak to be a threat but too strong to snuff out. He sneered at her, tried to stomp her like a cockroach.

_Sycamore, Lupin will die!_ A memory in his head, of Mastiff dying under his hands, of his mother’s countless warnings never to overdraw the soul. He grit his teeth, apologizing to his mother in his mind. Without the aid of another’s soul, she would die here by the Cinderwhip’s hand, but Sycamore would never leave her. He owed everything to her, loved her too fiercely to leave. But not enough to kill Lupin. Reluctantly, he snapped his connection to the wind, his connection to Lupin. It was a jarring thing, and he felt the reverberations in his own soul, his head throbbing with pain like he’d healed two dozen people. He could not do that again, even if there was another soul nearby for him to use. The way his soul felt drained, he knew he did not even have the strength to heal his mother. 

With his power faded, calm again surrounded him. His mother still lay sprawled in front of him, and he looked down on her with sorrowful eyes. He lamented his mistakes, a thousand different choices he could have made to be here sooner, to prevent her death. He shook those thoughts off. It was no use regretting now.

He turned to Lupin, who sat in a daze below him. He pulled his friend to a feet. So much was drained from his soul that he could hardly stand up. He looked at Lupin with steel eyes. “Take the others and run. Get as far as you can. I’ll – I’ll hold them off.”

Lupin looked to him, sense slowly returning as he listened. When Sycamore finished, he started to shake his head.

“Lupin,” Sycamore said with all the command he could muster, “Go. Get everyone out. Please.” Slowly, after a long moment, Lupin nodded. He must have seen something in Sycamore’s eyes, some of the understanding he had.

¬_I’m sorry, Magus, I don’t believe I’ll be able to fulfill my end of the contract._ If the Magus responded, he could not hear it over the sound of his own thumping heart.

He would die here. But he would do so to protect his clan, to protect his mother.

With a sway, Lupin turned to where the rest of the Heartwood still stood watching. He yelled something to them, but Sycamore was hardly paying attention. With a few steps, he moved past his mother. She was still alive on the ground, but he did not have the strength to heal her left in his soul, nor the strength to protect her in his speaking. He did have the strength, at least, not to let her die alone.

In front of him, the Fireglass had begun to regain order. The Cinderwhip rose to her feet from where he’d sprawled her out. A dozen cuts covered her face, dripping blood, painting her features like a demon’s. 
 
She looked at him with uncontained rage, and she swung her torches into the air. Fire spilled forth, twisting into long whips. He sighed as he connected to the wind again, discarding the brief hope that she had been weakened enough by the battle for him to overcome her.

She swung her whip and Sycamore threw all his strength into pushing the fire aside. He did not have the strength to disperse the fire, just barely enough to deflect it. The second strike came, and again, he barely deflected it. With the third, he was too weak.

The streak of flames tore across is torso, searing his flesh and burning his clothes. He felt the fibers of his clothes, the gift from Lady Opal, burst in to flames and turn quickly to ash. He felt his skin melt as the molten heat of the whip scraped across his chest. He cried out, in pain and desperate weakness.

Suddenly, there was a hand on his shoulder, and the wind picked up around him, slowly at first, but with gaining speed and ferocity as he felt that beacon of power light up behind him. Slowly, disbelievingly, he looked to the side to see his mother step past him. The sword had been pulled from her side, and she had stood by her own power. He felt tears come to his eyes, but they were immediately wicked away by the wind. A part of him had frozen when that sword struck his mother, but he was suddenly thawed.

Over the shout of the wind, he heard the roar of rage from the Cinderwhip. She was fed up with this, Sycamore could see, and instead of her whips, the fire came out in a wall, pressing against the wall of wind. It was a storm of air and wind, flowing in cyclone of destruction that whipped around them.

“I grow weak, Sycamore!” His mother’s voice could barely be heard over the shriek of the firestorm. “You must kill her!”

With a sudden urgency, Sycamore looked around him, searching for a weapon. He’d dropped his sword when he jumped to fight the Cinderwhip, and on the ground there was nothing but blood and stones.

“Hurry, my sapling!” His mother called. He could feel it now, as the wind slowly lost its force. His eyes widened with a thought, and he clawed at his waist, undoing the sling at his waist. It had been a gift from his mother, silent support in his goal of becoming stronger.

With a shaky hand, he scooped up a stone off the ground, ignoring the pain of the burn across his chest. He slid the stone into the cradle of his sling, and started to whirl. Jackdaw had taught him, early in his training, that hunters sometimes used Speaking to guide their arrows, to make tunnels of wind to keep their aim true.

He spotted the Cinderwhip through the waves of fire and wind crashing around him. He did not have enough strength to go up against such power, but with his last bit, he could puncture a hole.

He gathered the wind around him, what little wasn’t seized by his mother, and holding his breath, loosed the stone. At the same moment he shot the wind forward in a precise needle, hoping those days of practicing with leaves would pay off. In an instant, the stone was lost in the flames, and Sycamore’s heart leapt to his throat.

A moment later, the flames died with the Cinderwhip.

She collapsed to the ground, her skull cracked in the middle of her forehead. Sycamore swallowed his nerves, feeling a smile come to his face. Around him, he heard the remaining Fireglass soldiers call for a retreat, and he turned to his mother with a broad grin. She looked at him with a tired smile, swaying on her feet. He wrapped her in a hug, and she fell limp in his arms.

In a panic, he recalled her injuries. He had not healed them, so she must have borne them to the end. Lowering her slowly to the ground, he looked down at her side to find where the sword had stabbed her. He was weak, but now that things were won, he would not let her die in front of him.

He gingerly prodded her side with his hand, searching for the cut, moving his hand with increasing concern. Suddenly his eyes shot wide open, and he looked to her face.

“You-” he said.

“I healed myself,” She said, smiling up at him. Her voice was low, shaky, weak. She reached out a hand, touching his cheek. He shivered as he felt the familiar sensation of healing, fixing the worst of his burns. “You’ve overtaxed yourself too much to be fully healed, my Sapling, but that should fix some of the pain.”

“You healed yourself,” Sycamore said again, still in shock. She’d driven it into his head over and over again that you were never to heal yourself, that it was beyond taboo. But here, now, she’d broken that rule.

“I had to,” She said, her voice growing weaker, “I could never sit and watch you die.”

_Sycamore, her soul,_ The Magus sent grimly.

Sycamore reached out with his Healer’s Touch, and his stomach dropped at what he saw. Her soul was… leaking, energy flowing out of it like blood from a wound.

_What’s happening?_

_It’s ruptured. A common result of direct access to the soul._

“It’s going to be okay, mother, we’ve won and we’re free,” Sycamore said, his voice shaking.

_How do I fix it?_

_I – I don’t-_

_How do I fix it!?_

_You can’t Sycamore. Soul mages have struggled over this since time immemorial. Once a soul is ruptured. It’s only moments before they die._ There was sadness in his tone, real sadness, a truth he didn’t want to admit.

“It’s okay, my son, I’ve lived a long life.”

_There must be something I can do!_

_There is not. I’m sorry._

“You have so much more to live,” Sycamore pleaded, “You mustn’t give up yet. Things are just beginning.”

_You promised me power, Magus, but now you tell me I must watch my mother die in front of me?_

“I saw many die who were younger than me, Sycamore, many who deserved peace. I go to join old friends, now, dead comrades, Jackdaw’s parents, my father and mother.”

_I did all I could, Sycamore. You did all you could. Your mother decided to heal herself, despite knowing the cost. You cannot blame yourself._

“But I don’t want you to leave. Jackdaw, he – he says he’s sorry. For his impatience, his recklessness. He wants to tell you himself, so please-”

_But it is my fault. I had the power to kill the Cinderwhip, the power to heal her, but I did neither of those things, squandered my opportunity._

She laughed lightly. Her voice had fallen to a mere whisper, “That fool boy has nothing to apologize for. He was right, not me. Peace was always my dream, you know, my sapling, from when I was a little girl. I thought we’d made it in the village, but even there death seems to follow me.” Her whisper cut off with a cough, “Your brother was right, it’s an impossible dream. Perhaps when I die, I’ll find peace drifting on the wind.”

_You protected your clan as best you could. I know that, and so does she._

He vision blurred, full of tears, and they began to drip down on her.

“Before I go,” She said, “I have a question for you.”

“Of course,” He said between sobs, “Anything.”

“Have you lost yourself to the violence? Have you become like your mother?”

He was shaking now, and his words hardly came out between sobs, “No, mother, no. I hate it, I hate to see others in pain, hate that I had to kill to come here. I did it to find you, to free you. I want to heal them all, want to heal you.”

She smiled up at him, “I’m so proud of you Sycamore, for being so strong. Stay strong for me, even after I’m gone.” Her voice was barely audible, and he leaned in close to hear, “Those years in the village, with you and Jackdaw, they were the best of my life. I’m so proud to have been your mother.”

With that, her eyes drifted closed, never to open again. Sycamore’s cried, his voice carrying in a desperate plea for his mother over the stillness of the abandoned battlefield. Pike and Trout found him there, screaming his outrages over his mother’s dead body. He begged them to leave him, begged them to bring her back, but they could do nothing but help carry her to where their clan waited, free at last from the Fireglass.
