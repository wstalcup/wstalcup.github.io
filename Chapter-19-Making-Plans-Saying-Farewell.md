_At some point, the charms of the eastern ruins of the Kingdoms began to wear thin, and I longed for the comforts of a real bed. My companion, a woman born and raised in the capital, was quick to agree that the time had come for us to return westward. I was overjoyed when the boy agreed to continue travelling with us. I had become quite fond of his company. A farewell would have been a lonely occasion._

Excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

A cycle of emotion spun itself in Sycamore’s head as he waited in the sitting room for the council meeting to end. When it finally concluded, he sat somewhere between guilty, frustrated, and optimistic. Aides and attendants swarmed the councilors as they emerged from the chamber, discussing and reviewing arcane matters of management and bureaucracy. A few gave him pointed, disapproving looks, but most ignored him, too caught up in their own discussions. Lode glared daggers at him, huffing a muttered curse, and Sister Quartz gave him a significant, weighty look, but both left the building without addressing him.

When Lady Marigold finally stepped out of the chamber, she smiled broadly at Sycamore. Dismissing her single attendant with a wave, she approached him as he rose to join her.

“You could have warned me,” He said sullenly.

“Would your goals have been different had I done so?” 

“No, but it’s a decent thing to challenge a man to a fight before you punch him in the face.”

She laughed lightly. “I told you, I believe the best way to know someone is to cross swords. And, considering your refusal of my invitation to spar yesterday, a battle of words had to suffice. Besides, I expected you to have an understanding of what much of Whitebrook thinks of Westfolk.”

“Silkhairs and scarecrows,” Sycamore said.

She winced. “Yes, Lode is somewhat loose with his vocabulary. I scolded him on poorly representing the council after you left, do not worry,” She said with a nodded apology.

“I don’t particularly understand the significance of the words, nor does it particularly bother me,” Sycamore said as they exited the building. The council’s chamber was in a squat building nestled between the estates of the wealthy of Whitebrook. It was a short walk to Lady Marigold’s manor.

“If it does not bother you, then why do you seem so put out?”

“Because you knew of my ignorance on these issues, but gave me no warning of the kinds of accusations they leveled at me.” 

“I did not think it necessary. I had confidence you could hold your own, even without warning. To start out defensive would have played into their delusions. Your natural earnestness was enough, I’d say.”

Sycamore gave her a confused look, “My earnestness that broke into anger, enough to make me lash out at one of the people I was appealing for help. You believe that was enough?”

“I do. Additionally, You had not mentioned your ability to Speak. It was beyond my expectations,” She said wryly.

He shrugged, “Before I lost my temper, I didn’t seem remarkable.”

She eyed at him for a moment before shaking her head. “I wonder what goes on in your head, that you seem eager to heal mortal injuries without payment and view being able to Speak with the Wind at such a young age as normal. I suppose when your mother is the Storm Priestess, even the extraordinary seems mundane.” She waved a hand dismissively, “but that’s beside the point. I believe even for the most stubborn of our councilors, your outrage was easy to defend. The way they came after you, I wanted to slap them myself.”

“Yet you still voted against providing us with assistance,” Sycamore said with a frown. The roads were drying from a morning shower, and Lady Marigold hiked her dress as they stepped past a particularly large spot of mud.

“I did,” She said with an emphatic nod, “Do not misunderstand me. I understood your outrage and I hope for your success in whatever plans you make to save your clan, but my responsibility is to Whitebrook, and we cannot spare the soldiers to support you. It’s pragmatism, nothing more.”

Sycamore sighed heavily. He understood, rationally, what she was saying. By the sun and the sky, he knew that if he had soldiers to lead to his clan’s rescue, he would be reluctant to send them off on another clan’s errand.

“I suppose I should at least thank you for trusting us enough to give us information,” he said with half-hearted gratefulness, “Whatever small measure that is.” It was, of course, better than nothing. But at the start of the day, he had hoped for an army, so it was difficult not to be disappointed. 

“Do not underestimate the significance of that trust,” Lady Marigold said sharply. Sycamore was caught off guard by her tone, and he turned to look at her. The smile was gone from her face, and there was a pointedness to her gaze. “I’ll give you information, yes, but that alone hardly requires my trust. Do you expect my niece to sit idly by as you set off to carry out whatever scheme you think up? The trust I give you, that you earned, is to bring Juniper back alive, no matter the outcome. Aside from my wife, she’s the most important person in my life. Next to her safety, some information means nothing.”

Sycamore swallowed at the intensity of her tone, the command to protect Juniper. He forgot, speaking to her so freely, that she was a powerful woman, one of only ten to chart the course of the powerful Whitebrook clan.

“Now quickly, let’s return to the manor,” She added, the fire gone from her voice, “It’s grown late, and scolding Lode always makes me hungry.”

------

The map was spread across the table, weighed down on the corners by stone-stuffed leather packets. The detail enthralled Sycamore, his entire known world and more rendered in colorful ink. His eyes studied the western part of the map, noting the conspicuous lack of a village south of the Songwood. Further west were the rough marks of abandoned land, and beyond that a vague description of “Westfolk Lands”.

“The forces are to assemble at Rocky Ford, a day’s walk north of here,” Lady Marigold said. Sycamore snapped his eyes back to focus on her explanation. Pike, Lupin, Juniper, and He surrounded a wide table topped with the map. She tapped a dot on the parchment with a long wooden dowel. The name of the town was scrawled above the marker in careful script.

“From there we’ll make a campaign north though a handful of prison camps, freeing who we can and engaging any Fireglass forces we come across.” She sketched a rough line to the northeast of Rocky Ford with her pointer, crossing over a handful of villages. “We’ll rattle them enough to broker some peace with the Fireglass council. I’ve met their head, he’s a firebrand of a man with a rapier wit. We bleed them enough and he’ll cut our people loose before the damage stacks up.”

“And you’re confident that your army will win in the field?” Lupin asked with an eager tone.

Lady Marigold smirked at the boy, “Leave the military matters to me. You should focus on your clan.”

“You said the scouts spotted them, where exactly was that?” Sycamore asked.

She nodded, flipping through a book of notes in front of her. She made a few measurements on the map with her dowel before placing down a wooden marker. The marker was placed far to the west of the planned campaign, on the south end of the Redrock Mountains, a small range that ran east to west days to the north of Whitebrook.

“Here. The scouts reported sighting a prison camp where the prisoners are made to mine. The numbers match up with your description of the Heartwood clan.”

Pike looked up at her. “You’re sure it’s our clan?”

She shrugged, “As sure as we can be. This camp was a question mark in our reports until you provided an easy explanation. If they’re not the Heartwood, we don’t know who they are.”

Sycamore swallowed as he stared at the wooden marker. He imagined his mother and brother, in chains as they crushed ore to bits. The image brought bile to his throat.

“So,” Pike said, “What’s the plan?”

“It’s obvious,” Lupin said, smiling fiercely, “We go there and free our clan.”

Sycamore turned to Lady Marigold, “Did the scouts get an estimate of how many soldiers were stationed there?”

She glanced at her notes. “Between one and two hundred soldiers guarding between five and six hundred prisoners, including children and elderly,” She read aloud.

Sycamore bit his lip, turning to look to his clan members. None looked discouraged. He supposed that they knew, as soon as he reported his failure to secure an army, that they would be facing this alone.

He racked his brain for a way to even the odds, for some source of help that they had not yet tapped, but he came up empty. All those he knew were at this manor or in Fireglass chains.

Finally, he nodded, “I agree with Lupin. At this point, there’s nothing to be done but try to free them. What do you think, Pike?”

Pike smiled his usual smile. “I cannot wait to hold this one over Trout’s head for the rest of our lives.”

Sycamore felt himself smiling. He turned to Juniper. She nodded slightly, an unreadable expression on her face.

“If we’re in agreement, then that’s the plan. I don’t know how we’re going to overcome the numbers.”

“It hasn’t stopped us so far,” Pike pointed out.

“Yes, but thus far we have not been lining up to fight hundreds of trained soldiers.”

“There could be a thousand and I wouldn’t back down. When do we leave? Tomorrow?,” Lupin said with a touch of madness. Sycamore sighed.

“If I could make a suggestion,” Lady Marigold said, “Wait for our campaign to put your plan to action. We can’t provide you with an army, but hopefully we can make enough noise to give you the best chance of success.”

“I like it,” Pike said, “Trout and I have learned that our mischief is most successful when one of us creates a distraction.”

“I’m loathe to refer to us freeing our clan as mischief, but I agree,” Sycamore said.

Suddenly there was a bang as the door to the office slammed open. Sycamore jumped in surprise, whirling to find the source of the noise. Lady Opal stood in the open doorway, gasping for breath with a hysterical look on her face. Her braids, normally in perfect order, were in a tangle behind her head, and her face was flushed from the heat of running in a thick dress. In an instant, her eyes flicked between the map, Lady Marigold, and Juniper.

She spoke in a low, intense voice, “Tell me I’m mistaken and you’re not thinking of departing on some half-witted attempt at heroism.”

“Opal, this is not-” Lady Marigold started.

“Be quiet, Marigold,” Lady Opal snapped. She turned to Juniper, “Juniper, tell me I’m mistaken, please.” 

Juniper’s face resolved to a stubborn expression. “It’s no mistake, I’m going to join the others to free my people.”

“We are your people!” Lady Opal cried, “Is it not enough that my wife marches off to war, must you also go?”

“They are her clan, Opal,” Lady Marigold said.

“You’ve heard the story! Their village is burned! Juniper, your clan is in chains, must you join them?”

Sycamore saw Lupin working his jaw, fit to protest Opal writing off their rescue attempt. He glared sharply at the other boy, with a stiff shake of his head. This was not their fight.

“They are in chains, yes, which is why I must go. Can you imagine if Marigold was in chains, if I was? Would you be content to sit and do nothing while others worked to save us?” Juniper’s voice was growing in intensity, and Sycamore felt a surge of perverse shame. This was not a conversation he should be hearing, but he could hardly draw attention to himself by making to leave.

“If you go, the only thing I’ll be able to imagine is you in chains! Can you not stay, for me?” There were tears in her eyes, now, her hands shaking as they clenched at her dress.

“They killed my father,” Juniper said with surprising heat. Sycamore had almost forgotten her personal grudge against the Fireglass. It was a wonder she wasn’t frothing at the mouth for revenge.

“And your clan killed my sister!” Lady Opal cried, “And I hate them for it! Nineteen years ago, Lilac went west with some man from a clan I’d never heard of. The next time I saw her it was in an urn. And now, you wish to march off to die for them too. I’m begging you, don’t go!”

Sycamore’s eyes shot wide open in horrified shock. He looked to Lupin, who was studiously staring at the ground, and Pike whose face was a queasy shade of green.

“Sycamore, Pike, Lupin, leave,” Lady Marigold said, a tight frown on her face, “I believe Juniper, my wife, and I have some things to discuss in private.”

With the dismissal, the trio of boys just about sprinted out of the room.

-----

“I would like to point out that I’ve been pressing for this from the start,” Lupin said, sprawled on the grass. After fleeing the meeting, they found themselves in the gardens behind the manor. With excess energy and a desperate need to distract themselves from the confrontation they’d just witnessed, Pike and Lupin brought out the practice weapons and continued their training.

“Yes,” Sycamore agreed, “but that was as a first course of action. Even now, when it’s the only option available, I find it difficult to be happy about walking into hundreds of soldiers.”

“My Pa once told me that when there’s no other course, a desperate plan becomes simply the best possible option,” Pike said from where he sat, rubbing a sore spot on his side. Lupin had won the most recent spar with a rough stab to the ribs.

“I wonder if he knew that advice would be used to justify walking into hundred-to-one odds,” Sycamore said.

“Knowing my Pa, he’d probably be pleased that his words have such wide applications,” Pike said, “Still, you’re right. It’d be nice if we had more power, enough to send the Fireglass fleeing at the sight of us.”

“More power,” Sycamore muttered with a frown. The words brushed at a memory.

“Well, we best get back to sparring, then,” Lupin said, rising to his feet and giving his sword a few test swings, “Go on Pike, think of me as the Fireglass scum who put your brother in chains, maybe it’ll help you land a hit.”

The pair leapt into their spar as Sycamore stared off into space. Pike’s words tumbled in his brain. More power. A desperate plan.

Suddenly Sycamore’s eyes widened. He swore loudly. Lupin flinched at the noise, and Pike brought the tip of his spear across Lupin’s chest.

With a joyous yelp, Pike turned to Sycamore. Noticing his wild smile, he raised an eyebrow. “What’s the dopey look for, Sprout? You figure something out?”

Sycamore, counting the days in his head, grinned up at them, “The best possible option.”

-----

The call for recruitment went up around the city the following morning. As commanding officer, Lady Marigold was responsible for the management of the forces. She set off for Rocky Ford before the sun rose.

Juniper, Pike, and Lupin packed their bags following breakfast. Sycamore would be travelling far longer, and the cooks had not yet finished preparing his requested rations. It was midmorning, and the trio of Heartwood youths were set to head north as the others saw them off.

“You’re sure about your plan, right, Sprout?” Pike asked. He looked oddly noble with his hair combed out. Together with the well-tailored clothes, it aged him to the point that he would not look out of place in an army. They’d all been gifted a new set of clothing from Lady Opal, to make the marching more comfortable. Sycamore would save his for when he returned from his travels west.

“Yes,” Sycamore said confidently, “I’ll be there by the time you set off north. I promise.”

“You better not be using this as an excuse to skip the rescue mission,” Pike replied with a smirk.

“Sycamore wouldn’t do that,” Lupin said with a rare friendly grin, “He knows we need his sense if this thing has any chance of succeeding.”

“Take care of yourselves, boys, Juniper,” Mrs. Maple said with a motherly smile, “Stay safe, and keep an eye out for my husband.” Hickory waved at the departing three. Gramps nodded a silent farewell, Mist asleep on his shoulder.

“Juniper, I…” Lady Opal started. Her voice trailed off as she failed to find the words. Her eyes were red, and she did not look like she had slept much.

“I promise, auntie, I will come back alive,” Juniper said firmly, smiling softly . She stepped forward, wrapping her aunt in a tight hug. “Thank you for helping my friends, and thank you for letting me go.” Lady Opal tried to respond, but Sycamore could not make the words out through her shaking sobs. Eventually, they separated, and it was time for a departure.

“I’ll see you soon,” Sycamore said.

“I can’t wait for you to explain your scheme, whatever it is,” Said Pike, shaking his head as he hiked his pack over his shoulder. 

With a final farewell and a few brisk waves, the trio turned and left the estate. They would head north, join up with the other people of Whitebrook who took up the call for recruitment.

-----

Sycamore examined the contents of his pack, doing some mental arithmetic. Ten days of rations would be sparse if it was all he ate, but he could supplement it with whatever he could forage along the road. He planned to cut a quick pace, and if he wanted to make it to Rocky Ford by the time the army left, he could not spare the time to hunt and forage every day.

“Are you sure you won’t tell me what your plan is?” Mrs. Maple asked. She was helping him finish his packing. Truthfully, he had seen little of her since coming to Whitebrook. She’d spent her time with Lady Opal and her children. Sycamore took her distance from their planning as tacit trust that they’d do what’s best.

“I’m afraid if I tell you, you’ll try to talk me out of it,” Sycamore replied.

She sighed, handing him a tightly folded pair of trousers. “Yes, I know. That’s what scares me.” She paused, looking at him with a frown. “I’m sorry I can’t join you.” 

“I’ll make faster time alone, and it’s a long trip, so don’t worry,” Sycamore said.

“Not that. I’m sorry I can’t join you all in freeing our clan. It’s just-”

“You don’t want to leave your children orphans,” Sycamore said softly, a sad smile on his face. He understood her fears. As much as they masked the danger of their plan with confident smiles, they were walking into terrifying odds. Even with his desperate plan, there was little chance that they’d succeed. He could not ask her to put herself into that danger.

“I have so much to thank you for,” Mrs. Maple said, “You warned us of the Fireglass, helped with my children, managed to get us into the city. And now, I’m relying on you to bring back my husband, bring back our clan.”

Sycamore shook his head. “I can’t take credit for all that. And my mother would say that doing what’s right by your clan and by your friends is not an action that deserves thanks. I’m just doing what she’d expect out of me.”

“She’d be proud, you know, of how you’ve handled yourself,” Mrs. Maple said, “When she found you, those years ago, many were worried she wouldn’t be a suitable mother, that you would be unable to be happy in the clan, different as you were. I’m proud to see we were wrong.”

Sycamore stopped his packing, thinking for a long while about his mother, about what he had to do. He had little doubt she would not approve of his plan, but he would do it anyway. He had no other choice, they needed more power.

“I should get going,” He finally said, resuming his packing as he stuffed the remaining clothes into the bag.

“Right,” She said. She extended her arms, wrapping him in a warm hug, “Thank you, Sycamore, and good luck.” She released him, looking down at him with a smile, “Be sure to thank Lady Opal before you leave, she’s done a lot for us, you know.”

“Of course,” He said with a nod, waving once more to the woman as he left the room.

He found Lady Opal seated in the gardens, drinking a cup of tea as a midmorning snack. She gave him a level look. It would have seemed cold if her eyes were not puffy from crying at Juniper’s departure.

“So you’re leaving too?” She asked. Her voice was rough from tears.

“Yes,” He said with a nod, “I wanted to thank you for everything you’ve done for us. I know you’re not fond of our clan, but still, you’ve done so much. Truly, thank you.”

“I may not like your Heartwood clan, but I love my niece fiercely. When she asked if you all could stay, I could hardly reject her.” She sighed as she looked at him, and her eyes narrowed. “I don’t know how, but you’ve earned my wife’s trust, so I have no option but to place my trust in you as well. If you’re truly thankful for what I’ve done for you, bring my niece back. Even if it kills you, bring her back.” There was a fervor in her words, desperation.

Sycamore stared at her for a moment before nodding. “Even if you had not asked, I would have given my life to protect Juniper. I promise, whatever little strength I have, I’ll use it to make sure she comes home to you.”

Lady Opal looked at him for a long while, searching his expression for honesty. Finally convinced, she nodded.

“I have to leave. Thank you, again,” Sycamore said.

Gramps was waiting by the Manor’s entrance, smoking his pipe in silence. Sycamore paused to say farewell to him, but before he could say anything, Gramps spoke.

“When I was a lad, we placed importance on the first time you march off to war. If you did not kill an enemy and earn that honor, it was seen as a great failure.” He looked up at Sycamore, the cataracts in his eyes giving his expression a cloudy look, “Now, I realize that those thoughts were nonsense. When you march off to war, only one thing is important.”

“And that is?” Sycamore asked softly.

“Coming back,” Gramps said, “Now go. I’ll see you when you return.”

Sycamore gave a simple wave to the man, and turned to leave the estate. He set his pace to a quick walk, something that would put lots road behind him that he could keep up for hours. He only had twelve days until the army left, and he wanted as much time as possible to negotiate with the Magus.
