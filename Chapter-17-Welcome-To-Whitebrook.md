_It became a habit to instruct the boy on matters of the Kingdoms’ history as we walked. He took to the information like a starved man to food, learning faster than any student I’d ever taught. I asked, one day, why he was so curious. He answered that to learn this history was to learn more of himself._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

Sycamore awoke to rays of sunlight poking between his curtains, his back sore from sleeping on a bed too soft. The feather mattress was a luxury compared to the rough planks of the shantytown, the rocky ground of the roadside, and even the straw cot of his home. As such, despite the dull ache in his lower back, he could not complain.

He rolled out of bed, stepping lightly onto the carpeted floor. Casting off his nightshirt, he looked over his wounds. The cut on his leg was healing, and his bruises had faded from the splotchy red of a new contusion to purple and blue. His torso was a colorful, aching mess, but it was slowly healing.

A mirror was fastened over the dresser in the room, and he used it to check his face. Despite his normally youthful appearance, with the bruises and swells he had the look of a pit fighter. A scabbed abrasion extended across one cheekbone, above a wide bruise that colored half his chin an ugly blue. One of his eyes was blackened, and his lip was split in a jagged red line. A hand rose to his face, brushing the scar on his nose where Lupin had cut him months before. He recalled his promise of the time, to leave the scar as a recollection of his weakness and a hope for growth. A light laugh escaped his lips. Had he known back then that his face would take so much abuse, he would have let his mother heal the cut. The damage he saw in the mirror was more than enough of a reminder of his weakness.

Sycamore looked around his room, noticing that a servant had filled a basin of water for him to wash himself. Gingerly, he wiped himself down with a wet towel, removing whatever small amount of sweat and dirt had accumulated since the day before. When they first arrived at the estate, the head maid had refused to allow them past the manor’s entryway until they were fully bathed. Mrs. Maple had only barely convinced the woman not to burn their clothes, though she offered no guarantee about what would be left after a thorough laundering.

After changing his smallclothes and finding a suitable set of clothing from the wardrobe, Sycamore pulled on a pair of wool socks and slippers. The clothing was clean and smelled of some fresh detergent. He felt odd and out of place wearing such nice garments, but Juniper insisted that they were welcome to anything that fit.

Pike stepped out of his own room just as Sycamore emerged into the hallway. Both were accustomed to rising with the sun, and even in luxury it was a hard habit to break.

“Sleep well?” Sycamore asked his friend as they made their way from the guesthouse to the manor. Breakfast was served in a small dining room on the ground floor of the huge house.

“My neck aches,” Pike replied, “I believe my pillow is too thick. Still, it’s a fair bit more comfortable than the muddy planks of the shantytown.”

Sycamore nodded. “Agreed. Though I worry to become content with luxury and lose sight of our goals.”

“I would not fret over such things,” Pike said, “Lupin is quickly recovering, and when his confidence returns I have little doubt he’ll be barking for a chance to speak to the council.”

Since being beaten half to death, Lupin had been uncharacteristically quiet, tame in his complaints and willing, mostly, to follow after whatever the group decided. Sycamore did not expect this to last.

“His stubbornness does come in handy when it comes to picking himself back up,” Sycamore said with a wry smile.

They found their way into the dining room, where Lupin sat with Juniper and her aunt Opal eating breakfast. The smell of the food sent Sycamore’s mouth watering.

“Good morning, boys. I hope you had a pleasant sleep,” Lady Opal said. She was a pleasant woman of her early thirties. She looked the part of a wealthy lady, her hair done in a collection of intricate braids, held together by colorful ornaments that matched her simple but fine dress.

“We did, thank you,” Sycamore said, nodding a greeting to Juniper and Lupin as he sat at the table. The food was a basic, if luxurious, spread of eggs, freshly baked bread, and fruit. He filled his plate with gusto, doing his best to emulate the table manners of Lady Opal, but feeling like a savage nonetheless.

They ate for a moment in comfortable silence before Lady Opal spoke again. “How are you adjusting to your time in Whitebrook? Have you any concerns that need addressing?”

Sycamore shared a moment of eye contact with Pike and Lupin. Three days had passed since their sudden entrance to the city, a stroke of fortune that still felt surreal after the catastrophe that ended their time in the shanties.

“I could not be more comfortable,” Pike said between bites of bread, “though I admit I’m not suited for inaction.”

“I feel the same,” Lupin said, “And I was thinking of working a sweat by swinging my sword around, if you would like to join, Pike.”

Pike grinned, “That sounds to be a fine idea. I grow twitchy if I go too long without a spat. What do you say, Sprout?”

“I’d say I have enough bruises already without enduring one of Lupin’s spars. I’ll pass on the offer. Take care not to hurt each other too bad, though,” Sycamore said, “I’d still rather avoid healing if possible.”

“Yes, yes,” Pike said with a wave of his hand, “We’ll control ourselves. I swear, you sound more like your mother every day.”

“You know I take that as a compliment,” Sycamore said with a smirk, “Though I hardly have the poise to scold you to tears.” Pike shuddered at the thought of one of Poppy’s lectures, and Sycamore found himself laughing as the conversation lulled.

Lady Opal looked between the Heartwood boys, a small smile on her face. “Aren’t you boys too old for games with swords?” she asked. 

Sycamore felt the mirth leave his expression. “Too old for games, yes,” he said softly. He rubbed at his jaw, scowling at the ache.

Lady Opal frowned. “I’m sorry,” She said, “with your laughter and smiles, it’s easy to forget…” Her voice trailed off, waving a hand as she searched for the words.

“To forget that we will soon have to use our swords?” Pike offered.

“To forget that our clan lies in chains somewhere, waiting for us to pull them out of the flames?” Lupin asked bitterly.

“To forget that you are not children, with children’s plans and children’s burdens,” Lady Opal finished, a tightness at the edge of her lips. Sycamore did not know if it was taboo to talk of such things over a meal, but she seemed averse to any conversation that did not bring laughter and smiles.

“By rights we ceased to be children on the first hunt of our fourteenth year,” Sycamore said, recalling the boar and the feast that felt so long ago, “In actuality childhood left us when we watched our village burn to the ground.”

“My Pa always said that experience makes a man more than age,” Pike added with a nod.

“Speaking of such things,” Lupin began, leaning forward over the table, “Have you any news of the council? Has Lady Marigold been able to appeal for us?”

Pike glanced at Sycamore, an eyebrow raised in question. Sycamore shrugged in response. Normally, he would stop Lupin forcing such a topic, fearing awkwardness or rudeness. But after three days of resting in the manor, he, too, was curious about where things stood.

Lady Opal’s face took on a wooden look, a forced smile on her face, “I don’t believe such things are appropriate talk for breakfast. Of course I understand your curiosity, but could we perhaps save this discussion for a more appropriate time? Our stomachs would not forgive such a heavy conversation topic.”

“No, Auntie, I’d like to know as well. Aunt Marigold is so busy with the daily council meetings that I hardly have a chance to speak with her,” Juniper said, speaking at the meal for the first time.

Lady Opal made eye contact with her niece for a long moment before sighing. “Fine. I only know what my wife has told me, so I cannot tell you much. I don’t know if she has brought up your specific circumstances to the council, but you should know that they are moving quickly to respond to the Fireglass threat. Any more than that and you’ll have to ask her.” She paused, wiping at a corner of her mouth with a napkin. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I made a promise to Lady Maple that I would give her family a tour of the gardens this morning. I believe she is waiting for me.” With a quick movement, she stood up, gathering her skirts in a hand a hastily stepping out of the room.

An awkward silence fell over the table. “I’m sorry,” Lupin started, “I did not mean to offend with the question.”

“No, that’s alright. It’s my fault for forcing the topic,” Juniper said, picking at the last of her breakfast with a fork, “Though I struggle to feel remorse. My aunt avoids uncomfortable topics like a plague, and I grow tired of endless banal conversation.”

“I hope she does not think us ungrateful for her hospitality,” Sycamore said, “We’re impatient, perhaps, but still beyond grateful.”

“And I’m sure she understands as much,” Juniper said, “Even if she wishes you were content to smile and laugh and compliment the cooking.” She set her fork down, rising to her feet. “I should go apologize, it wouldn’t do to leave her frustrated at us.”

“Tell her that breakfast was delicious for me,” Pike said. Juniper laughed, nodding to the boy as she stepped out of the room.

That left the three Heartwood boys seated around the table. A moment passed in silence before Lupin slapped a hand on the table. 

“Well, what do you say then, Pike?” he said with a smirk, “Games with swords?”

Sycamore spent the day walking the streets of Whitebrook. It was the rainy time of year, and from midmorning a light shower muddied the streets. His boots, recently mended by a cobbler, were a comfort on his feet after the socks and slippers he was expected to wear in Lady Opal’s manor.

The city was a marvel to Sycamore. He knew thousands of people lived within its limits, and that was not including the farmers and woodsmen who provided the city’s resources. Even in the rain, the streets were a bustle of activity that left him breathless. People going about their business filled the wide avenues, merchants arguing deals and laborers hauling product. Hawkers stood on street corners, young boys and girls yelling advertisements and selling bits of food and trinkets. More than once a voice called out to him, asking if his stomach was empty or if he had a need of new gloves. After an insistent boy managed to sell him a wire bracelet he had no need of, he learned to ignore their calls.

He found himself wandering back to the manor in the mid afternoon when his stomach reminded him that he had not eaten lunch. His natural sense of direction thankfully guided him back to the estate, though once or twice he found himself turned around at a familiar street corner. Finally, he came upon the familiar gates of the manor, the single guard waving him past in recognition.

Sounds of activity drew him around the manor into the gardens behind, a walled tract of land that made up most of the estate. There was an open sprawl of green dotted with shrubs, and beyond that a dense garden of flowering ivy and blooming plants of a host of colors. Well-pruned trees stood around, providing shade to stone benches and tables suited to taking a meal or a meeting in good weather. It did not have the practical organization of Sycamore’s mother’s herb garden, instead reveling in the joy and beauty of nature. In the middle of all that, he saw Pike and Lupin taking a beating at the hands of Lady Marigold.

Lupin lashed out with his sword, some kind of wooden practice blade, in a sideways cut. Marigold, with her own wooden saber, easily deflected the blow with a small movement, sending Lupin in a stumble forward. She swatted in him the back with her blade, and he tumbled to the ground.

Meanwhile, Pike, attacking from behind, stabbed at her back with a dull wooden spear. With a quick sidestep, she avoided the blow, grabbing the haft with a tug that robbed Pike of his balance. She slashed his leg in a move that sent him sprawling. As pike scrambled to regain his footing, she took a short step forward and pressed the point of her sword to the underside of his chin.

“Better,” She said after a beat, dropping the tip of her blade and helping Pike to his feet with an extended hand. He stood up with a groan, rubbing at his thigh where she had smacked him. “You’re still too hesitant to take an opening, Pike. Why wait for me to finish dispatching Lupin to attack? You saw your moment, be faster to seize it. And Lupin,” She said, turning to the boy who sat with a petulant frown on his face, “Aggression is good, but don’t forget your advantages. Time your attack with Pike’s. Even the greatest swordmaster cannot overcome a disadvantage of numbers. And I am not the greatest swordmaster.”

“Could’ve fooled me,” Lupin said with a pout. Lady Marigold let out a full laugh, turning towards Sycamore. He was surprised she had noticed him in the flurry of action.

“Sycamore, it’s good to see you, would you care to join us in our training?” She asked him with a confident smile. Lady Marigold was a striking woman. She was near as tall as Pike and moved with the smooth confidence of a seasoned warrior. Her long hair was done in a tight bun of braids, and she wore loose-fitting, movable clothing. Her eyes had a sharpness that matched her skill with the blade, and the trio of scars on her angular face spoke to her experience in honing that skill. She was, by all accounts, beautiful, though Sycamore had little understanding of such things.

“I’m afraid not,” Sycamore said quickly, smiling back. She was an affable woman and Sycamore liked her, though they’d seen little of her since coming to the manor. “I fear if I have any more bruises, I’d be more bruise than boy.”

“You just don’t want to get knocked on your rear,” Pike said, wiping at the sweat on his brow, “it’s a weakling’s excuse.”

“If that’s true, the next time you get bruised up, I’ll be sure to beat you with a stick so you can prove you’re not a weakling,” Sycamore said with a smirk.

“I’m too tired for quips,” Pike moaned, leaning on his spear with all his weight.

“Yes, save your energy for the spars,” Lady Marigold said, “Now up with you, Lupin, Again, and better this time.”

“Spare us, please!” Lupin cried, “You offered to help us in our training, not repeatedly thrash us around.”

She grinned evilly at him, “Ask my father and he’ll tell you there’s no difference.”

Sycamore’s stomach growled, and, taking pity on the pair of exhausted boys, he called out, “Lady Marigold, could you show me to some food? I hate to interrupt your training, but I haven’t eaten since breakfast.”

She glanced at Sycamore before eyeing Lupin and Pike. After a moment, she sighed. “Fine, take a rest, you two. I expect you to get a good hit in when I return.”

“Thank you, Sprout!” Pike called out as he collapsed on the ground, lying back to rest.

“Walk with me,” Lady Marigold called, tossing her saber to the ground as she took off at a brisk pace. Sycamore jogged to catch her as they made their way towards the servant’s lodging.

“The cook should have some leftovers from lunch,” She explained simply. Sycamore nodded understanding and thanks.

“It’s a shame,” She continued, “That you’re unfit to fight.”

“Looking for a third victim?” 

She chuckled lightly but shook her head, “I’d like to get to know you better, and I find there are few ways to get to know a person better than trading a few blows.”

“I promise you I’m better at having a conversation than swinging a sword,” Sycamore said, “I’m not much for a fight.”

“I’ve seen your bruises, heard the story of your trek to Whitebrook. You’ve more experience with bloodshed than most your age.”

“Which is exactly why I’m not much for a fight. When I fight, it’s with desperation.”

“I believe most fight with desperation when it comes down to it,” She said. Sycamore considered that briefly. He thought of those he’d fought, Lupin with his sword, the singing Fireglass, the vengeful bandits, Mastiff and his thugs.

“What about those that don’t?”

“Bullies or madmen,” She said.

“Good to know I’m neither of those, then.” There was a quiet moment before she spoke again.

“My father fought against your people in a war, you know,” She said suddenly. Sycamore’s steps caught and he looked to her, searching for any sign of prejudice or anger. She looked back at him with clear eyes, though her smile had faded. They paused in their walking.

“And what did he tell you?” 

“Many stories, almost none pleasant. The theme was consistent, though. Never trust a silk-hair, scarecrow Westfolk.”

Sycamore said nothing, but the words rang familiar, slurs called to him by angry patients, unable to accept his help.

“Can I ask you for advice?” Sycamore finally said. When she nodded he continued. “For my entire life, I’ve been treated differently for how I look. My eyes, my frailty, my size, these things were thrown in my face as insults.” Memories of crying to his mother came back in a flush of nostalgic shame. “Finally, not two months ago, I learn that these things are not because I’m broken or a runt, but because I’m of the Westfolk. And then, after things turned dark, I left my village and learned that to be Westfolk is a crime to some.”

“What advice do you want?” Lady Marigold said softly.

“How should I feel about this? Should I be happy to know I’m not some broken child, doomed to be a runt for all time? Or should I be upset that there was truth to what my tormenters said, that I was different to the rest?”

They stood for a long moment of silence before Lady Marigold responded. “I’ve heard much of your difficulties to this point. Word spread of a savior, healing refugees under a cowl nearly free of charge. Juniper brought you here and told me of how you’d helped her through her father’s death. Lupin says you saved his life, healed his wounds despite the harm it caused you. Pike describes you as a loyal friend, says you’d leap into any fray if it meant protecting your people. Lady Maple praises you for your calm head and treatment of her children. Even my own wife complimented your manners and politeness.”

“I don’t understand,” Sycamore said, flushing from the secondhand praise, “None of that has anything to do with me being of the Westfolk.”

“Yes, but it has everything to do with who you are, Sycamore of the Heartwood.” She gestured with a hand, and they continued their walk. “Whether you are Westfolk or Hillfolk, those are the actions of a considerate, confident man.”

Sycamore struggled to see the point she was making. “Then what is your advice on my identity?”

“Do not pay attention to the prattling of those too focused on how you look to care about how you act. Westfolk or Hillfolk, you are who you are, and as long as you are happy with the way you live your life, there is no need to fret over what others think.”

They arrived at the servants’ quarters, kicking dirt off their boots as they stepped inside. A thought occurred to Sycamore.

“What of your father, then?” He asked.

Lady Marigold laughed mirthlessly. “He was a bitter man, haunted by memories from that war until the day he died I learned many lessons from him, but I did not learn his hatred of the Westfolk.” She pointed towards a door, “through there should be the cook. Tell him I sent you and he’ll happily serve you some leftovers from lunch.” She was about to leave when she paused, turning back to him. “I’ll speak to the council today about your clan. Do not expect much from them, but I will get you some time to petition. It’s the least I can do after you were there for my niece.”

“Thank you,” Sycamore said, “For helping my clan, and for the advice.” 

She waved a hand at him dismissively, “You’re young, Sycamore, advice from us older folk is expected. If you really want to repay me, return to health quickly. I’d like to get to know you better, and without crossing blades, conversation only does so much for me.”
