_At times I wondered if my meeting the boy was truly a chance or some act of fate. I saw too much parallel in our stories, too many ways to relate to him. As a historian, I knew much of serendipity, as history itself could be summed simply as a series of meaningful coincidences. I asked him what he thought of such things and he considered it for a moment before shrugging. He explained that sometimes, the wind moves to lift the bird’s wings, exactly as it needs._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

Pike found him limping back to their hut, blood still seeping from his cuts and scrapes.

“Stormy skies, is that you, Sprout?” Pike said, rushing to Sycamore, supporting him with a shoulder. Sycamore gratefully leaned against his friend, removing some of the weight from his aching limbs.

“What happened?” Pike asked.

“I went to help someone and paid for it,” Sycamore said bitterly, spitting a glop of bloody phlegm to the side.

Pike spat a curse. “That’s a fine thank you for the healing you’ve been doing. I’m sorry, man. I should have gone with you, watched your back. Things are too rough out here.”

“Wouldn’t have helped. There were too many of them to fight back. They led me like a rabbit to the snare,” Sycamore clenched his jaw, wincing at the surge of pain from where Mastiff punched him. “You don’t need to apologize for anything. My own foolish lack of caution caused this.”

“Enough of that,” Pike said, “We’ll get you patched up back with the others. Then we can track down the men who did this.”

“I have a name of who did it, but I doubt we’ll find him. They talked of leaving after draining me dry. They took the money, Pike,” Sycamore said, despair creeping into his voice, “All that I earned today was in my purse. We can’t afford to go into the city without it.”

“That’s alright, Sprout,” Pike assured him, “most of it is back in the hut. We’ll be okay. We can report them to Administrator Moss. I’m sure he would be less than happy to hear of bandits wandering just outside his city.”

Sycamore nodded mutely, but had little faith that the bureaucrats of Whitebrook would help. The reminder of their stash of money did sooth some of Sycamore’s concerns. He had been robbed of the day’s earnings, yes, but they were still a fair bit better off than they had been when they arrived at the city. 

It was a painful walk back to their shelters, and Sycamore was glad to see the familiar shape of the huts. Those feelings did not last when they stepped inside to find Lupin sprawled on the ground in the middle of a ransacked mess. Sycamore’s stomach plunged in cold understanding. Somehow, Mastiff had found this place.

Their packs were torn apart, clothes and possessions scattered about the room. Sycamore saw his spare shirt, stomped into the ground and covered in mud. He saw his last bit of jerky, saved for a celebration, slotted between two of the floor planks. Most of his possessions he spotted throughout the hut. The one thing he did not see was the linen bag that held the rest of their money. In the middle of it all lay Lupin, curled on his side, his eye swollen shut and his ankle twisted at an awkward angle. He was shaking with barely controlled sobs.

With a curse, Pike released him and rushed over to Lupin, Sycamore hobbling close behind him. He moved to roll the boy onto his back, frowning when Lupin flinched at his touch. He looked even worse than Sycamore felt. His face was a mess of bruising, one eye swollen shut and the other blackened. Blood seeped at his hairline where his scalp had been torn with rough treatment. Sycamore imagined his torso was a mess of abrasions and bruises, and his ankle was clearly broken. 

When Lupin recognized them, he began to mutter hysterical apologies.

“I’m sorry, Sycamore. I tried to fight them off but they took the money,” He said. Tears streamed out of his eyes, leaving streaks in his grime-covered face.

“That’s alright, Lupin. It’s not your fault,” Sycamore said automatically. Pulling up Lupin’s shirt, Sycamore looked for any serious wounds. Dark red contusions spread across his ribs, but with a few ginger pokes, Sycamore was relieved to feel that none seemed to be broken. Just the ankle, then.

He turned to Pike, “We need to set the bone before I can heal him. I want you to brace his leg.”

Pike nodded but gave Sycamore a concerned look, “Can you even properly heal in your current state? You look halfway to death.”

“I can’t very well leave him like this!” Sycamore said with a frown. His headache was still there, but it was impossible to say how much of it was from the assault by Mastiff and how much was from over-healing. It did not matter. Lupin needed healing.

Pike looked at him for a long moment before finally nodding. “Just tell me what I need to do.”

“Hold his leg and make sure he doesn’t squirm too much,” Sycamore said before looking to Lupin. “We’re going to set your leg now Lupin. This is going to hurt, but as soon as it’s finished I can heal you.”

The boy was hardly listening. “You gave us a chance to move forwards, and I just let them snatch away our opportunity. Just like in the village, I failed to protect.”

Sycamore sighed, hoping Lupin would recover his wits somewhat when the healing was through. He reached out to the boy with his Healer’s Touch, wincing as a spike of pain buried itself in his head. He bit back a curse as the pain slowly faded. Sycamore forced himself to ignore it as he assessed the boy’s soul. Thankfully, Lupin wasn’t losing much blood and his wounds were mostly superficial, aside from the ankle fracture, so despite how he looked, he still had energy to spare for healing.

Sycamore moved to Lupin’s leg. “Hold him steady, Pike,” He warned. Pike grunted understanding, leaning to hold down Lupin’s legs. Sycamore took a deep breath and jerked Lupin’s ankle, sliding the bone back into the correct position. Even before Lupin yelped in pain, Sycamore was already starting the healing, guiding the boy’s essence to his various wounds and watching with a keen eye as his injuries repaired themselves, making sure none drew too much energy from his soul.

While the healing happened, Sycamore felt a sickening draining sensation, like the blood was being pulled from his veins. He groaned as his soul roared protest at the overuse, spasms of discomfort assaulting him. When the process finished, he felt a queasy emptiness, and a wave of nausea swept over him. Fearing the state of his soul, he directed his Healer’s Touch inward. He winced when he saw the erratic, abnormal movement of the ball of energy that lay at his core. It seemed Pike had been right to worry about whether he should be healing anyone. With a bitter sigh, he focused back on Lupin.

Though his physical state had improved, Lupin’s emotional state was much the same after the healing.

“I’m sorry, Sycamore,” He said again, “I couldn’t do anything. They came in numbers, and I tried to scare them off, but I was beaten down like a dog.”

“Right, right,” Sycamore said, feeling a sudden surge of wooziness as his weakeness from his own beating caught up to him. He had pushed it off to tend to Lupin, but he was exhausted and in pain.

“Sycamore, are you all right?” Pike asked with concern.

Lupin continued in his rambling. “We’d finally found an avenue forward, a way to make progress, but I let the chance slip through my fingers with my own impotence.” 

“That’s okay, don’t worry,” Sycamore muttered, rubbing at his head to try to banish the daze. His thoughts drifted as he struggled to recall why Lupin was apologizing. He tried to rise to his feet, wincing at a surge of dizziness and pain. That’s right, they were robbed, their money taken. 

“What about this situation is okay?” Lupin said, “I’ve done nothing but fail since the Fireglass came to our village. I failed my father when I let them take my brother and sister, I failed our clan when I was too weak to pursue the Fireglass. And now I fail you all, unable to stop common thugs from robbing us of our path forward.” He scowled bitterly, rubbing at his face with a fist, smearing his tears into the dirt and blood on his skin. “It would have been better for you to have left me dead on the floor of the smithy, then at least I would not be holding you back!”

Before he could offer his assurances for a third time, the world suddenly inverted as the last bit of Sycamore’s awareness faded. He fell forward, fainting in a heap.

-----

As he lay on the hill staring up at the sky, Sycamore realized he was altogether tired of aching. Mentally, he tallied the hurts since finding the village in ash. A punch to the head from a Fireglass raider at Mrs. Maple’s vineyard, his shoulder roughly torn up in the fight with the bandits, and now a collection of bruises, cuts, and scrapes from Mastiff. His memory since the assault on the village seemed to be little beyond various shades of pain and despair.

Administrator Moss was apologetic that they had been assaulted, but offered little help besides a promise that he would arrest a man matching Mastiff’s description if he tried to gain entrance to the city. He scolded Sycamore for his trusting them, clicking his tongue at a few details. Severed fingers were an old punishment for thievery, still used in places where fines were deemed insufficient. According to Administrator Moss, It should have been the first tip that the man was a scoundrel. Of course, Sycamore hardly had any recollection of a crime being committed in the Heartwood clan. Even if crime found itself to their clan, Sycamore was certain his mother would not have allowed a punishment as brutal as the severing of fingers.

Thinking of his mother, Sycamore wondered if she had ever been so reckless with her healing. His soul had weakened considerably after mending Lupin’s wounds, and he did not know how long it would be until he could heal again without risk of killing himself. Because of this, they could not continue as they were before, Sycamore healing for money to pay the fee to enter the city. All it took for their plans to be destroyed was a pair of careless mistakes from Sycamore, naïve trust and senselessness about his healing.

So, with nothing to do but wallow in his pain, Sycamore spent the afternoon lounging on a hill, far enough from the shantytown that he could not smell the stench of mud and despair that hung over that place. Lupin wandered the muddy paths in a foul mood, determined to track down those who attacked him and enact his revenge. Pike had accompanied him, promising to stop Lupin from getting himself killed. There was more too it, though. Sycamore had seen the creases of anger on Pikes face. He was a loyal friend, and Sycamore suspected he would search tirelessly for an opportunity to return the favor of the beatings. Sycamore was far past worrying over such things though, resigned to the reality that good intentions and hard work were often repaid with pain and disappointment. There was nothing to do but wait and pray that hope would again show its face. He stared into the sky, watching the clouds float by and feeling the wind brush over him.

As he lay there, in the shade of an oak tree, he wondered about the wind. When it set off, from whatever far off land it came from, did it know where it was going? Did it choose a course, follow a path until it arrived? Was the wind on a journey of great purpose, traveling to some end too arcane for him to understand? Or did it wander without a whim, going wherever it chose, past mountain and storm, until it came to rest where it needed to be? It was a futile thing, to ponder the wind, but things as they were, Sycamore found himself longing to dissolve into the breeze, be taken on a journey whichever way his heart desired. At least then, perhaps, he would no longer ache with endless injuries.

“Sycamore?” A girl’s voice called out, “Is that Sycamore, of the Heartwood clan?”

Sycamore, pulled from his daydreams, sat up in a hasty motion, wincing with the movement. He looked around, searching for the source of the voice. It was a familiar voice, tugged at his memory.

“Sycamore, up here!” The voice said, and Sycamore looked up. Above him, in the branches of the oak tree, a girl sat, legs dangling over a limb, her hair hanging down, obscuring her face.

“Who’s that?” Sycamore called up to her. The voice was familiar, but something struck him as uncommon. It came to him that his memories of this voice were not of conversation, but of yelling and screaming, crying in protest. 

“Hold, a moment, I’ll climb down,” The girl said. A scramble of movement later, and she landed on the ground softly. Her hair was in a loose braid, and she wore common clothes. The only thing individual about her was the bow on her shoulder and the quiver on her hip. Sycamore’s eyes widened in recognition.

“Juniper?” He said, jaw dropping. He hadn’t seen her since her father’s funeral. His confusion lasted a moment before he put things together. “Of course!” He said, nearly smacking himself in the forehead, “You came east to Whitebrook.”

“That’s right,” She said with a nod, “My mother’s ashes were given to her sister, and I thought it best to bring my father to join her. I’ve been here since.”

“And how are you doing?” Sycamore asked. Speaking to her, memories of that traumatic time came back. The feelings had dulled in the time since, but he could still vividly remember her wail of pain when they found her father’s body.

“I’m okay,” She said softly. Her voice was sad, but it was the old sadness of a scar.

“You look, sound – better,” Sycamore said awkwardly. Juniper was a few years older than him, and she had always been quiet. It would be a stretch to term them anything more than acquaintances.

“Thank you,” She said, looking off to the distance, “I feel better. Coming here gave me time to think, gave me some separation from the darkness of my father’s death.” She turned back to him, frowning, “But that’s enough about me. What happened to you? You look like you’ve been through a storm. And what are you doing in Whitebrook? Are Aunt Poppy and Jackdaw with you? I still owe them thanks for being so supportive before.” 

Sycamore’s breath caught in his throat when he realized she knew nothing of the raid on the village. She knew nothing of the truth of her father’s death.

He shakily rose to his feet, discarding the aches and pains, “That’s a larger question than you know, Juniper. Come with me, the others will want to see you.” He stumbled as he rose, and she grabbed his arm, steadying him. He offered her a thankful smile, and felt a surge of kinship towards this girl, another member of the Heartwood clan, alive and free. “Many things have happened since you came to Whitebrook, and they’ll be overjoyed to see a friendly face.”

-----

“So my father, his death was not an accident?” Juniper asked after Sycamore finished the explanation. He’d led the girl back, and the others had been overjoyed to see her. None were particularly close with the girl, but that they found another member of their clan was worth celebrating.

“No,” Sycamore confirmed, “I’m sorry it was kept from you. My mother did not wish to burden you with such dark information when you were already so troubled.” He glanced around at the muddy, filthy shack, “Though, now, such thoughts seem to be naïve denials of reality.”

She nodded, “Things started to get worse shortly after I arrived at the city. When the refugees began to arrive in numbers, there was a scramble to stop the city from overflowing. I worried after our clan’s safety, had a feeling in my stomach that this would reach even our home. Perhaps that’s why your tale doesn’t shock me. I think I always knew, somehow, that this chaos was connected to my father’s death.” She smiled sadly. “I guess this just confirms what I already believed.”

“I’m sorry,” Sycamore repeated. There was little else he could say.

There was a heavy moment of silence before Mrs. Maple spoke up. “It is wonderful to see another familiar face, dear. Have you been living in the city?”

“With my Aunt Opal, yes,” Juniper replied politely. “My mother was from Whitebrook.”

“You look much like Lilac,” Mrs. Maple said, “It’s a sadness you never got to know her.”

“My aunt says the same. According to her, I’m a copy of my mother at my age. She wept when she first saw me, thinking I was her sister, come back from the dead.”

“That must have been a shock,” Pike said. He and Lupin had returned halfway through Sycamore’s account of the events since Juniper left the Heartwood. They’d had no luck in finding Mastiff.

“It was. Seeing her tears set me off weeping as well. Any that saw us would have thought us off in the head,” She said.

“And has the city treated you well?” Mrs. Maple asked. 

“It took me time to adjust to the crowds and the bustle, but my aunt has been more than hospitable.”

“How did you end up on that hill?” Sycamore asked. After all the trouble they were going through to enter the city, he couldn’t imagine willingly leaving.

She smiled at him, “I like to leave the city, every so often. Aunt Opal seems to hate it, but I feel more at peace in the limbs of a tree than dodging runners on the streets. This time, though, I was looking for you.”

Sycamore blinked. “How did you know we were here?” 

“Yesterday I was walking when I heard a rumor that there was a Westfolk boy healing folk among the refugees. I figured it was too specific not to be you, so I hoped to spot you and Aunt Poppy. I wanted to thank your family for helping me through my father’s passing.” The smile fell from her face. “I wandered through these huts for a while, but the oppressive atmosphere sent me running before too long.”

“I can understand that,” Sycamore said, thumbing the bruise on his jaw. He was surprised that the rumors of his healing had extended even into the city, but he was glad that something positive had come out of his efforts, even after being robbed.

“I went to catch my breath by climbing some trees. As luck would have it, you happened to choose the same hill.”

“Call it luck, or call it the pull of the wind,” Sycamore said.

“Whatever we call it, I’m sad to hear Aunt Poppy is not around for me to thank. I’m sadder still that she’s in chains somewhere with the rest of our clan.”

“If my mother were here, she’d scold you for trying to thank her for helping,” Sycamore said with a small smile, “She considers everyone in our clan family, and to help family is expected. I think that’s why she takes so much pride in her healing.” He poked at a sore spot on his side. If his mother would here, that also would not be a problem.

“From the sound of what you’ve been getting up to out here, I believe she’s not the only one who takes pride in her work,” Juniper said.

Sycamore waved a hand dismissively, “Nonsense. I was taking advantage of these people, taking their money to heal them. My mother would sold me till my ears fell off if she heard as much.”

Lupin scoffed before speaking, “Sycamore, you nearly killed yourself yesterday when you healed me. Take some pride in your work or I’ll become irritated.”

Sycamore bristled at the unexpected praise. “That’s different. You’re a member of our clan, I couldn’t very well let you suffer like that. It wouldn’t have been right.” Pike laughed suddenly, and Sycamore forced a change in topic. “Will you be alright to get back into the city, Juniper? I’m sure you’ve seen the strictness about it.”

The girl nodded, gracefully allowing him to divert the attention back to her. “They took a census with the start of these new fees, so I was already in Whitebrook. Besides, I’ve come and gone in the city enough that they should recognize me by now.” She frowned. “It’s a shame I can’t pull you along with me. I hate to leave you out here.”

“How much money do you have?” Lupin asked.

“Lupin! That’s too much to ask,” Mrs. Maple scolded. Sycamore swallowed. He’d been thinking the same thing, and if Lupin hadn’t asked he’d likely have brought it up. Perhaps he’d have been less blunt about it, though.

Juniper did not seem to be offended at the question, but she shook her head. “I’m sorry, I hardly carry any coins on me. I would ask Aunt Opal, but knowing how high the fees are, it would be a big ask. She’s already done so much for me by allowing me to stay, you see.”

“We understand completely, dear,” Mrs. Maple said, though Sycamore sensed minor disappointment – even Mrs. Maple must have hoped that Juniper would somehow fix their problems.

“It’s a shame, though, I really wish I could help you,” Juniper said with a frown, “Is there some other way for you to get inside the city?”

“Not unless your aunt is a member of the Whitebrook council,” Pike said.

“How would that help?” Juniper said with interest.

“It’s the other way to get into the city,” Sycamore explained, “Pay a fee or be invited by a council member.”

“I see. You should have mentioned that,” Juniper said with a smile.

“Your Aunt Opal is a member of the Whitebrook Council?” Mrs. Maple said with shock.

“No,” Juniper said, “But her wife, my Aunt Marigold is.”

“Then that means-” Sycamore said.

“I can’t promise anything, and I have to ask her, but I’m sure she’d be more than happy to help out members of my clan,” Juniper said.

“So we can enter the city?” Pike asked, shock plain on his face.

“Hopefully, yes. And I believe my aunt will want to provide you beds, as well.”

There was a moment of stunned silence, and Sycamore found himself beginning to laugh. His jaw ached, and the laughs sent spasms of pain through his torso, but he could not stop. He could not place why the situation was so funny to him, but from the sound of the way the others laughed with him, he was not alone in his appreciation of the irony.
