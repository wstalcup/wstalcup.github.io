Sycamore sat on a rock aside the West Road, tossing the last piece of bread into his mouth. He’d prepared a few days of food before leaving the library, but from here, he’d have to forage and hunt until he reached the Kingdoms.

_For the last time, I’m not changing my name. My mother gave it to me, and you wouldn’t have me toss out her legacy, would you?_ It was an ongoing argument, one he was not willing to lose.

_I don’t believe your mother would like it if you were immediately spotted out for having a Halfling name._ In an effort to boost Sycamore’s fluency, they’d started communicated only in the tongue of the Westfolk, the tongue of the Kingdoms.

_I’ve agreed to translate the name into your tongue, is that not enough?_

_People do not name their sons after trees in the Kingdoms, Sycamore._

_Too bad._ He sent stubbornly, ignoring whatever snide reply came.

It was early spring now, and Sycamore thought back to where he was last spring. He shook his head, recalling how terrible he’d felt not to be called on the first hunt. He rubbed at his leg, remembering the stone that he’d fallen on, the stone that had ultimately led him to the Magus’s sanctum and introduced him to the annoyance that plagued his soul.

_Recall that I have something riding on this too. If you get yourself killed before we can answer the questions of my past, what am I supposed to do?_

_I suppose you’ll have to wait for another to find your sanctum, and then convince them to go west._ Sycamore sent wryly.

He felt the Magus’s frustrated huff and smirked to himself. They’d grown quite close in their months of isolation together, and Sycamore better understood the man he’d bound his soul to after reading through many of the books in his library. It was easy to annoy him.

_What is the plan, once we reach the river?_ Sycamore asked, changing the subject. They’d long since passed Hillfolk lands, finally finding where the West Road picked up in Westfolk lands after days of wandering. According to the Magus’s memories, there’d once been villages of Westfolk here, but they had yet to meet any. Eventually, they had to cross a great river called the East River. It confused Sycamore at first, but according to the Magus, that was the eastern bound of what he called ‘civilized Kingdoms land’.

_There was a bridge, in my day, but who knows if even that remains._ The Magus’s voice trailed off. They had yet to learn how long had exactly passed since the Magus’s day; it was the first of many questions.

_If there’s no bridge, what then?_

They took a moment to bicker over the options but the sound of steps cut them off. Looking up from where he sat, Sycamore’s eyes widened to see two travelers. One was a bold looking woman wearing worn brown leather armor over her clothes. She had long blonde hair that was tied in a bun. Sycamore was shocked at the familiarity – it was the same texture as his – silkhair. Her eyes were brown, like the Hillfolks’, though they were small like his.

Next to her stood a man so tall that it boggled Sycamore’s mind. The woman was a good bit taller than even Pike and Trout, but the man she walked with was huge, more than a full head taller than her.

_Are all of men of the Kingdoms this tall?_

_No. He’s exceptional, even by Kingdoms standards._ Sycamore swallowed nervously as he looked at the pair on their approach. Unconsciously, he reached for the wind, connecting to its power. He hoped it would not come to violence, but these were the first Westfolk he met, he had no idea what to expect.

“Hello there,” The man called, an easy smile on his face muting some of the intimidation of his size. He had broad features, a strong jaw and a thick brow under a shaggy mop of curly brown hair. Despite that, his limbs were frail and he did not have the same warrior’s demeanor as the woman.

“Ah – hello,” Sycamore said awkwardly. He had spoken their tongue endlessly in his mind with the Magus, but it was rare for him to use it out loud.

“Are you two – I mean,” Sycamore started, scrambling for a question.

“We’re wanderers, if that’s what you’re asking,” The woman said, amused smile on her face. Sycamore nodded. He was going to ask if they were Westfolk, but that was quite obvious by their looks.

“She’s a wanderer, I travel with more importance,” The tall man said with a wink, “You see, I’m a historian.”
