_The boy had many strange moods. He would often giggle to himself, or frown at nothing in particular. He seemed distracted by silence, constantly shifting his focus at nothing in particular. It was odd, to observe him. But, then, I suppose if you watch anyone long enough their neurosis will reveal itself._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

“So we’re in agreement, then,” The Magus said, his voice bouncing around his sanctum.

“Yes, yes,” Sycamore said wearily, rubbing a hand at his eye in a vain attempt to push off his exhaustion. They’d been at it for hours, discussing the specifics of the agreement, the nuance of the contract with which they were to bind their souls.

“Tell me the terms again,” The Magus said, “We must be absolutely clear on that. They’ll be branded in our souls, a condition of the contract. I need to know you understand.” Sycamore heard it in his voice, the well-contained eagerness, cautious excitement.

“We are to bind our souls, each giving the other support. You are to teach me in magic of the soul; instruct me on Westfolk matters, including magic, language, and culture; and provide advice and counsel for as long as the contract remains in effect,” He tallied the requirements on his fingers, “In turn, I am to serve as your eyes and ears in the world, help you fill in the blanks of your past, and grant you one favor, to be decided on later.” The favor was a last minute addition to the bargain by the Magus, Sycamore’s punishment for revealing his desperate need for power.

“And the favor, what are its limitations?”
	
Sycamore sighed. The details were important, he knew, but they’d gone over these specifics a dozen times already. “The favor will not harm me or anyone close to me in any way, and the deadline for granting it will be set to ten years. Should this deadline pass, I will no longer be required to grant it.” There was a lingering uneasiness about the favor, a worry that somehow Sycamore might be missing nefarious intentions behind the requirement. But, with as much time as they’d spent on discussion, Sycamore was far too exhausted to worry about such things.

“Yes, that’s right,” The Magus said eagerly. 

“Is that enough, then?” Sycamore asked, “Can we seal this contract?” His patience was at an end. “You were the one who offered this bargain, initially, are you not eager to move forward?”

“I am, of course,” The Magus said defensively, “but this is a large commitment.”

“As you’ve beaten into my head since I arrived,” Sycamore said.

“Yet still, your impatience remains. I’m compelled once again, my young friend, to ask if you are truly prepared to make this commitment. This is not a promise of word, nor even an oath on blood. This is larger, deeper, a contract of the soul,” Gravity had come to the Magus’s voice at some point, a significant weight that snapped Sycamore out of his complaints.

He thought long and hard about the Magus’s words. The time limit for the favor was ten years. He imagined where he would be in ten years, where he had been ten years ago. It was almost an unimaginable amount of time from him. And no answers about the Magus’s past would come from his library. Those records extended until the day his tower was razed. If they wanted answers, they’d have to venture west, beyond Hillfolk lands. Could he truly make such a tall commitment?

His hesitation lasted only a moment. He thought of his clan in chains, his friends marching towards impossible odds, his need for strength, now more than ever. Next to those things, worries for the future were dust.

“I’m prepared,” Sycamore said, the weary complaint gone from his voice.

“Then step forward and place your hand on my Soul Stone,” Said the Magus.

Sycamore rose from where he was perched on the floor, ignoring the groan of his knees, weary from the hasty travel west. He approached the altar of white, gold-veined marble, the center of the sanctum, the vessel for the Magus’s soul, his Soul Stone. With a slow, significant movement, Sycamore extended his hand, placing his palm down on the smooth stone. He was surprised to feel it was warm to the touch, pulsing with the energy of the Magus’s soul. He shivered at how oddly alive it felt.

“Reach out with your Soul Sight and connect your soul to mine. You should feel the terms as we’ve discussed, understand them instinctually. You must keep them in your mind, maintain this connection, no matter the shock or pain you feel.”

“Pain?” Sycamore asked. The Magus hadn’t mentioned this before.

“It’s an unnatural thing, the contract we make. The soul may protest. You must not allow its complaints to shake the connection of our souls. It could be catastrophic.”

Sycamore’s mouth suddenly felt dry. He knew what pain to the soul felt like, after healing Lupin in the shantytown. His soul had just recovered, and he was not eager to feel that again.

“You have done this before, haven’t you?” Sycamore asked skittishly.

“I have… read extensively on the process,” The Magus admitted, “But I assure you my understanding is complete.”

Sycamore blinked, a wave of uncertainty passing through him. But no, it was too late to second guess. “Fine,” He said, “I’ll make sure that the connection maintains itself.”

There was a pause before the Magus replied. “Good,” He said, “Hold that connection, remember the terms, and leave the rest to me.”

Sycamore nodded, reaching out with his Healer’s Touch, his Soul Sight, to connect to the Magus’s soul. It still warred with understanding to see a person’s soul within the altar in front of him. He knew, from experience and instinct, that the soul was not only within the altar, but the whole hill, yet still, through his Soul Sight, it seemed to be no different from any other he’d seen. He pushed these distractions out from his mind. Now was not the time for such things.

With an effort of will, he reached out to the Magus’s soul, that loose ball of yarn that pulsed with golden energy. He clasped one of the tendrils of power, guiding it slowly back towards himself, and with an inward look, coaxed it to connect to one of the tendrils of Sycamore’s own soul. 

He felt a jolt of shock as his instincts screamed for him to sever the link, it was unnatural, dangerous, wrong. With a grit of his teeth and an effort of will, he suppressed these instincts and maintained the connection.

“Good,” The Magus said, his voice strained. Perhaps he too felt the shock of the connection. “Now maintain that as I work the contract into our souls.”

Sycamore grunted agreement just as he felt a surge of information dump itself into his mind. It felt a bit like when the Magus spoke through his soul, but instead of hearing a voice, he suddenly had new knowledge. A series of terms in flowery, formal language, repeating all the things they had agreed upon. With so much focus on maintaining the connection of their souls, he only had half his concentration to verify the Magus’s terms, make sure there were no hidden tricks in the wording.

“The terms, Sycamore,” The Magus said.

“What?” It was difficult to speak and still keep his concentration.

“Are they as we agreed?”

“Yes,” Sycamore finally said, “Yes, they seem sound.” He hoped it was not simply a lack of attention, but he could not find anything wrong with the information as he saw it in his head.

“Then I will now seal the contract,” The Magus said, “Take heed, I believe this will be more painful than I anticipated.”

Sycamore nodded mutely. Since the moment their souls touched, he knew this would not be comfortable. But he could handle pain. Since the assault on his village, he’d felt so much. All on the path to returning things to as they were. Here was just another painful step forward towards strength.

“Brace yourself,” The Magus said. Sycamore clenched his teeth. He would not let the connection break, no matter what he felt.

A knife of force suddenly stabbed itself into the very center of his being. He clung to the connection with all his will. He felt himself screaming in pain as the blade dug itself deeper, jagged ice and searing flames tearing at his soul. He tasted iron, felt his cheek scraped raw from the gnashing of his jaws. It was the worst pain he’d ever felt, a thousand times harsher than the beating by mastiff, a thousand times deeper than a stone buried in his leg. But still, with the last vestige of his control, he clung to the connection. Finally, in an explosion of pain and light and truth, the knife withdrew itself, and his senses faded.

He saw a boy, in poor, ragged clothing. His mother and father smiled at him, they sheltered him. The city was large, much larger than Whitebrook, the buildings tall and rich and beautiful, but not where the boy lived. He snuck out of the alleys, dodged horses and dogs to climb an ivy-covered wall. Beyond was the girl. Like his parents, she, too, smiled at him.

There were more now, friends and comrades. Few knew of his origins, a stone picked up from the mud, polished until it shone. They praised him for his intellect, for the strength of his eyes. The girl was still there, but his parents had died long before. Joy left him when he buried his mother and father, still smiling at him in death. Since then, they called him Stoneeyes.

He was respected for his research, given a title of great significance. He had followers and peers who yearned for his praise and respected his opinion. But it meant nothing to him. His research, to find the solution for the mud, for his parents’ pain. That was all that mattered. She still smiled at him, but there was worry, now, where there once was peace.

They sent him east after he crossed the line one too many times. All those years later, and still they saw the mud in his origin. They could not strip from him his knowledge, and so his title remained. No longer a girl, the woman from beyond the ivy-covered wall cried when he departed. He did not.

He was distracted from his research by a trio of orphans. They’d heard stories of a ghost in a stone tower, hoped to find treasure to buy food. They looked up at him, covered in mud and stinking of fear, and he saw himself. He tried to smile down at them like his mother and father had to him, but he no longer remembered how.

His apprentices did not understand his research, and he feared to teach them. He answered their questions when they worried, but could not explain it when he no longer had to eat or drink. Stoneeyes they had called him, and now his body too was of stone and mortar.

Stone could not burn. He knew that, even as he felt the flames crash into his body. He’d known this day would come, when they’d come to push him back to the mud. They had not understood his research, not wanted him to find the answers to his questions. He had only three regrets when he felt the stone crumble under the heat. That he had not been able to pull his parents from the mud. That he would not get to see the girl’s smile again. That he could not watch his apprentices grow so far that they left the mud behind.

A dry mouth, a sore neck, and an aching head greeted Sycamore when he awoke. He groaned his discomfort, pulling himself up to his elbows. His muscles were stiff from a long rest, and he craved water fiercely from dehydration.

_I’ve Opened the spring_, The Magus’s voice said in his head, _You must be thirsty_

“Stoneeyes,” Sycamore muttered, leaning over to the basin of water, drinking greedily. The cold water stung the inside of his cheek. He vaguely recalled tearing it raw as the contract imprinted on his soul. He spoke again in the breaths between water, with a louder voice, “Why are you speaking in my soul? There’s no one around to hear.”

_Since the formation of the contract, speaking like this is as easy as thought. I have no voice, and so to project myself as I have been requires some energy. Before, it was less than speaking through our souls, but now, this is effortless._

_I see_, Sycamore said through his mind. He blinked, surprised by how natural it was.

When he’d drank his fill, he rose to his feet. _Magus_, he sent, _When the contract formed, I saw-_

_I imagine a mirror of my own visions of you, a summary of my life, old memories. You must have questions, but they are for another time, when we’ve resolved this business of the Fireglass. I find myself increasingly motivated to help you after seeing your history.¬_

Sycamore flushed at the thought that the Magus saw his past. What had he seen? A pitiful boy, bullied for his weakness?

_Look at your soul_, the Magus sent, cutting off Sycamore’s self-loathing. With a nod, Sycamore reached inward with his Healer’s Touch. His brows furrowed as he examined the changes in his essence. On the surface, his soul looked much the same, a pulsing ball of golden energy with dozens of tendrils looping off it like string. Within, though, he could see a change. Where his soul, before, shined brightly in a continuous color, there was now a spot of discoloration, a pocket of different energy, writhing like a boiling yolk in the center of his soul.

_It seems to be trying to break free,_ Sycamore sent, ¬_Like a worm trying to burrow to the surface._

_If my research is correct, that should settle down as the days pass, and the contract should more fully integrate itself into our souls. Thankfully, you did a respectable job of maintaining that connection, and there should be no risk of the contract breaking suddenly before things have calmed down._

_I imagine I don’t wish to know the consequences if that were to happen._ Sycamore sent, recalling the spike of pain to his soul, the tearing feeling as it drilled into the very center of his essence.

_You don’t._ Sent the Magus, a shudder in his voice.

Sycamore was about to complain about how the Magus had failed to warn him about these dangers when his stomach growled. He realized how hungry he was. Grabbing a bit of his remaining rations from his bag – some hardtack mostly crushed from his rough travels to the Magus – he sent, ¬_I’m hungrier than I expected. How long do you think we were out?_ He noted while gnawing on the bread that it was quite convenient to be able to talk and eat at the same time.

_I believe I woke up shortly after the contract was formed, perhaps because of my greater experience with soul magic._ There was a pause _You were out for two days._

Sycamore coughed around a mouthful of food, sputtering his shock. “Two Days?” He said aloud, doing some mental arithmetic. He would still have time to make it to Rocky Ford, but only just. With the four days of his journey to the library, the half day spent arguing terms, and now two days of sleep, he barely had the time he needed to reach the army before they set out. _I need to leave now,_ He sent. He swallowed the last bit of food in his mouth, suppressing his remaining hunger. He could eat on the road. Pulling his waterskin from his pack, he dunked it in the spring. He frowned as bubbles slowly rose from the mouth of the pouch, willing it to fill faster.

_Calm yourself,_ Sent the Magus, _A few seconds will not make a difference._ Sycamore glared at the marble altar. _There’s one more thing we must do before you leave._

_This one will not result in me passing out for two days, will it?_ 

¬_It will only take a moment. Behind you, on the shelf, there’s a wooden box. You’ll find a necklace in it, a metal chain with a red stone._

When his waterskin was full, he set it aside, following the Magus’s instructions to a small wooden jewelry box. Inside there was a host of rings, bracelets, and ornaments, and Sycamore’s eyes widened at the obvious wealth. After a moment of shock, though, he searched through the box until he found what the Magus asked after. He pulled the necklace from the box, a long silver chain with a red gem affixed in some metal clasps.

_If this is some sort of gift for me, I must remind you that I am in quite a rush,_ Sycamore sent sarcastically.

_Silence. Pry out the gem from the necklace, but be careful not to break the clasps._ Sycamore pulled his skinning knife from his belt, using the blade to carefully bend back the bits of metal that affixed the red stone in place on the pendant. When it came free, he carefully dropped it back into the jewelry box, placing the wooden container back on the shelf.

_Now,¬_ The Magus continued, ¬_Take a piece of one of the corners of my Soul Stone and set it in the pendant where the gem was. The stone should chip easily with your knife._ Sycamore approached the marble altar, slapping the back of his knife at one of the corners of the odd warm stone. He was surprised when a chunk of stone almost immediately broke free. He rolled the bit of stone between his fingers for a moment, feeling its strangeness, before carefully clasping it into the pendant.

¬_What’s this for?_ He sent. The rock was an awkward shape for the pendant, but without too much effort he was able to bend the soft metal until it fit well enough.

_I was worried that distance might weaken our connection. While you were sleeping, I thought up a solution. The soul is immutable, and anchored to all of my Soul Stone, here. So if you take a bit of it with you, it should be as if you are always here, within my library. In theory._

_In theory_, Sycamore repeated, not fully understanding. He had a grasp on the basics of soul magic, but knowledge of the more arcane properties of the soul still eluded him. With a final bit of effort, he bent the last clip around the stone. After a quick examination, he hung it around his neck, tucking it into his shirt. He felt the stone’s strange warmth on his chest, felt the small thrum of power within. 

_With that,_ The Magus sent, _I believe we should be prepared to leave. I’m excited, you know. It’s been many years since I last left this Library, and I look forward to seeing the outside world._

Sycamore grabbed his pack, briefly stretching his legs out before he made his way up the stairwell. He winced at the sunlight as the Magus opened the hill, blinking several times as he stepped into the late spring weather. It was a cool morning, perfect weather for travel.

_I won’t ask you not to be excited, but give me your focus. You promised me power, and I have a whole clan waiting for you to deliver._

-----

The ability to speak through his mind proved immediately convenient, as Sycamore was able to constantly discuss with the Magus without running out of breath.

_And that’s why I believe that your Speaking and healing are far more connected than it may seem,_ The Magus sent on their second morning of travel, concluding a long explanation.

Sycamore frowned over his breakfast, some berries from a bush they passed, with jerky and hardtack. The Magus’s ideas made sense, but it still seemed a stretch. He thought over his protests, sending them to the Magus as he licked his fingers clean. He rose with a bit of effort, doing his best to ignore the pain from his travel-sore legs. As he started on the day of walking, the discussion began again in earnest.

By midday of the third day of walking, things had come to a head. _What you propose is dangerous. I did not learn to heal for such, and it goes against everything I’ve learned_ Sycamore shouted through his mind.

The Magus sent his thoughts calmly, _You’ve repeatedly told me you want power, and what I have told you is the easiest way I can see to gain it._

_There has to be some other way. What about Westfolk magic? You once told me that you could teach me the magic you know._

_Perhaps I could, with the right supplies and a year’s time. But we have mere days, and there are limitations there that you do not understand. I assure you, I have considered your situation meticulously. This is the best way._

Sycamore was silent for a while, ideology warring with need in his brain as he stared down at the dirt path they walked over. Eventually, need prevailed.

_Fine,_ He sent, ¬_I’ll consider it. But only as a last resort. In any other situation, I cannot justify the risks._

_Finally, you see reason,_ The Magus sent, ¬_Now, tell me what you know of the Fireglass encampment. I have seen my fair share of wars, and perhaps I can be of assistance when it comes to strategy._

When he was not arguing with the Magus, Sycamore spent his time practicing his Speaking. His outburst in the council meeting had shown his growth, but if he wished for his abilities to play an impact in their assault on the Fireglass camp, he would need to push his skills even further. To that end, his days were filled with a constant gusting of wind around him as he used whatever energy he could muster to pull more and more strength from the wind, working himself until exhaustion every night.

Finally, after four and a half days of discussion, arguing, and endless practice, a sea of tents came into view. They’d veered north off the West Road a day earlier, cutting the corner of Whitebrook on their way to Rocky Ford. Sycamore was drained from the travel, but could not help but smile when he saw the military encampment surrounding the town. He’d made it in time.
