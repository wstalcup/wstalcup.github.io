_He spoke in a strange tone, his words lilting and dancing in an unfamiliar accent. Whether this was characteristic of easterners, I had no knowledge. I asked him after his parents, but he gave no response. He requested to know where we were travelling, and when I gave no sure answer, he thumbed at his pendant for a moment, as if considering. He asked to accompany us, at least for the day. My companion and I shared a first of many unsure glances. A boy alone in the wastes of the eastern plains made for a strange travelling companion, but then, considering my own circumstances, I had little room for complaint._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-------

Twice in two days, now, had Sycamore fled his shame south. He fled the images of Lupin’s demonic grin, of Trout and Pike fighting to defend him, of his brother walking away while he suffered at the hands of his tormentor. He focused only on moving his feet. He rushed past the edge of the village to the rocky terrain beyond. Hills rose in front of him, but he did not stop, surging over them, up and down, up and down. He mutely hoped that he would not repeat the previous day’s mistake, lose his footing, and smash his skull open on the ground. Fate, he reasoned, was not so cruel. 

A short while later and he was out of energy, out of room to ignore. He sat roughly down on a hilltop, gathering his thoughts and his breath. When he wet his lips, he tasted iron. Blood dripped down his face, flowing from the wound left by the tip of Lupin’s sword. He poked at the cut, felt a bit of his nose missing. He pressed the edge of a sleeve onto it, wincing at the rough material. Dust, kicked up by his steps, clung to the sweat beading on his face and arms. The cool spring air prickled his skin, chilling him as Lupin’s words repeated in his mind.

He threw the taunts aside, reminding himself why he had come south – not to flee but to find. The hare, or its carrion, was somewhere around, waiting for Sycamore. He scanned the hills, searching for a landmark from yesterday’s hunt. His eyes came to rest on one hill in particular, the tallest around. A sudden memory of his dreams flashed before him, fire and cold on the tallest hill. He shivered and tore his eyes off it, suppressing the thought. This was not the time for distractions of childish fancies.

Dusting himself off, he stood. Spots of blood covered his shirt from his rush to the south, and his sleeve was stained where he had used it to staunch the bleeding. He paled at the thought of his mother’s scolding over ruining another piece of clothing, but that was a concern for later.

Determined to find some sign of the hare, he set off at a trot. His mind wandered while he searched, intrusive thoughts, echoes of Lupin’s taunts. His brother, exemplar of strength and confidence. His mother, proud of one, ashamed of the other. And he, the worthless foundling, still as helpless as an infant in the mud. He wondered, sometimes, whether he spawned out of the muck where his mother found him, the cold filth dyeing his hair black and his eyes green.

He spotted a familiar brook aside a rocky overlook. Crouching down, he checked around where he had found the hare. A small stone, crusted with fur and blood, lay on the ground. He thumbed at the sling tied around his waist, remembering the weight of it as it whirled in the air. How much trouble would have been saved had he been more accurate?

Striving to remember which direction the hare had fled, He looked around. Again, his eyes came to rest on that tallest hill. More memories from his dream, the hare, shrieking as it hobbled away, towards the hill. He dismissed the thoughts, delusions formed by a wine-soaked mind. He had not followed the hare enough to see where it fled, so he could not possibly know where it had gone. Another moment staring at the hill, and he resumed his search.

His mother, family name sworn off to become a healer, no children of her own, had taken in Jackdaw and watched him grow into a man of great repute. She had taken in Sycamore and watched him flounder as the runt of the clan. She said he had hidden strengths, he would grow in time, but those were the fleeting hopes of a mother afraid of her son’s failure.

Long minutes of searching and reflecting, and he found himself unconsciously drawn towards that tallest hill. Sycamore felt a moment of pause as he pondered why the hill drew him so fiercely. Perhaps it was not so peculiar, to be told in dreams such things as where to find one’s quarry. His mother often spoke of listening to the wind, but it was rare for her to define exactly how the wind spoke. Far be it from Sycamore’s place to deny the wind of dreams. He took a step, as if hypnotized, towards the hill. Other images from his dream danced to the forefront, of fire, and crumbling stone, and a statue of an unknown man. He swallowed his nerves and continued forward. First, the hare.

Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the dark red of meat adjacent the white of bone. Trance broken, he whipped his head to the side, and saw what was left of the hare. Sycamore spared one more look at the hill from his dreams before trotting over to the hare to study it. Little remained besides a smear of gore and a few bones. Crows or vultures had picked out its eyes, feasted on its flesh. Sycamore felt a surge of pity at the sight, a strange kinship to the little thing. Like the hare, ill fortune had led Sycamore to an injured leg the day before. Unlike the hare, however, he’d had a village to return to, a mother to scold him.

Briefly, he considered what it would be like if, as Lupin taunted, he was banished from the village. How would he have fared the day before without his village? A lone boy, leg cut and bloodied, without a mother to heal him or friends to relieve his dark mood with company and humor. He shuddered. But how would they fare if he was gone? His mother would feel sadness, no doubt, and perhaps Trout and Pike would remember him fondly, but few would suffer without his presence. 

He brushed the cut on his nose with a finger, a reminder that he had been too weak. The bleeding had stopped, but it stung still. He would not let his mother heal this cut, the scar to be a lasting memory of his need for growth. His mother often spoke of his potential for the future, but that potential would amount to nothing if he wallowed in self-pity. He would beg Trout and Pike for their forgiveness for fleeing. And he would thank their pa, whose advice had proven true. His failure had been great, but the lesson was greater. Strength would come; all that remained was effort and growth.

-----

Sycamore lay prostrate, awaiting the judgement of his friends. His mother, muttering of pride, had roughly bandaged his face. Surprisingly, she had offered little protest when he requested she leave his nose unhealed. Perhaps she saw the change in him. Or perhaps she simply grew tired of healing his cuts and scrapes.

After a midday meal, Sycamore had gone in search of the twins. Trout and Pike looked little worse for wear from the morning’s brawl – in fact, they seemed hale compared to that morning, recovery from the hangover, no doubt. This soothed some of Sycamore’s worry. In the back of his mind, he had feared Lupin had gone unhinged and assaulted the twins with his blade. Thankfully, this appeared not to be the case. Still, he owed them an apology, for abandoning them that morning and for ceaselessly relying on their protection.

He stared at the ground, expecting rebukes. Pike let out a sudden bark of laughter. Sycamore looked up, eyes wide. Trout, the more contemplative of the pair, grabbed him by the arm, pulling him to his feet.

“Up, Sprout,” He said, “There should be no kneeling between friends.”

“But, I don’t understand,” Sycamore said, “I left you this morning to fight my battle. At least scold me!”

The twins shared a look.

“Firstly, we’ll not scold you, as we’re not your mother,” Pike said.

“And I did not leap upon Lupin with a thought of fighting a battle for you,” Trout said, “He deserved a thrashing, and I was thankfully there to help you deliver it. I seem to recall you throwing the first punch, getting a few over that big brute before he could respond.”

“Yes, but still, I-“

“In fact, I think it’s we who owe you the apology,” Trout continued, “We should not have let Lupin speak so freely of you without response. That you, who so often shows restraint, were driven to blows shows we waited too long. Apologies, Sprout.”

“You do not need to apologize to me!” Sycamore cried. The confounding twins were making a mockery of his attempt at humility.

“Oh, but we do,” Pike said, “That bandage on your nose shows it. I cannot imagine what Mr. Aivis was thinking when he gave his weasel of a son that sword, but I’m sure he’d not be happy to see how his boy uses it.”

“To carry the thing strapped to his waist at all times, pretending some skill with it: arrogance topped with brutality,” Trout said.

Sycamore recalled the blade dangling above his eye. He shivered. They were right about that. 

“At least let me apologize for running off before it was brought to a conclusion,” Sycamore pleaded.

“I suppose, in that, I’d appreciate an apology,” Pike said, “Say what you will about Lupin, but the fox can throw a punch. My poor shoulder still hurts where he laid one out on me. Would have appreciated some healing after that.”

Sycamore sighed, exasperated. This was not how he had expected things to go.

“You think too much, Sprout,” Trout said, “Like Lupin said before, we’re a trio. I will never be angry if you pick a fight for us.”

“As long as you’re there to patch us up if things get too rough,” Pike finished.

Sycamore rubbed at his temple, the instinct of shame battling with the joy of friendship. He finally sighed, annoyed that he could not make his grand gesture of apology, but ultimately thrilled he had such friends.

“Then, if not apologies, let me say thank you. I can’t imagine what would have happened had you two not been there to save my skin,” Sycamore said.

The twins grinned. “Always a pleasure to throw a punch for a friend,” Pike said, “Now come. Trout and I had plans to skip out on our evening chores and practice with our slings. Your instruction would be appreciated.” 

“Besides, I believe you owe us a conclusion to the tale of the hare. I daresay it will be a story to rival Pike’s encounter with the boar,” Trout said, setting off for the empty field where they practiced their slings.

Jackdaw found him while he ate. His brother joined them for dinner on the insistence of their mother, making small talk of the day-to-day of the village. Sycamore ignored any attempt at conversation, unsure of how to feel about Jackdaw. He was angry with his brother, for not calling his name to join the hunt and for not knowing how Sycamore suffered at Lupin’s hands. But he also knew he couldn’t blame the man, who was too busy with the affairs of the clan to bother with Sycamore’s social problems. Sycamore had never asked for his brother’s help, nor did he expect it. Still, it stung to know his brother didn’t consider him strong enough to be recognized as an adult in the clan. And then again, the slight redoubled that morning when Jackdaw seemingly immediately sided against Sycamore, taking Lupin at his word.

But whose fault was Sycamore’s weakness? Could he truly blame his brother for his judgement? Sycamore’s reflection drove him to silence over the meal. When it concluded and the conversation wound down, Jackdaw turned to Sycamore.

“Well, brother, I said earlier I’d like to discuss something. Would you care to join me for a walk?”

Sycamore nodded mutely, standing and following Jackdaw out of their home. As he was leaving, he heard his mother call out, “Luck, Sapling.” Over his shoulder, he glanced at his mother, trying to puzzle out her meaning. 

They walked for several moments in silence: Jackdaw, collecting his thoughts, Sycamore, unsure of what to say. In the back of the younger brother’s mind, Lupin’s taunts looped – banishment and disappointment. He hoped, knew, that such things would not come to pass, but still a nugget of fear remained.

Jackdaw started to speak, and Sycamore’s breath caught.

“First, brother, I’d like to offer an apology,” Jackdaw said as he walked, “I had not realized how important for you it would be to join the hunt, and it was my mistake to not warn you of my judgement.” Jackdaw glanced at Sycamore, who was unsure of how to respond. He had expected many things, but an apology was not one of them.

“I thought you content with your talent, enough that something like this would not shake you. But that’s my inexperience, forgetting my own pride at joining the first hunt thirteen years ago.”

“My talent?” Sycamore said, confused, “Brother, I would forgive you for not noticing, but compared to the other children in the clan, I’m talentless.”

This gave Jackdaw pause. “Mother says you take to knowledge like a fly takes to honey,” He said, “It could be maternal boasts, but she claims you are more talented than even she at healing. High praise, coming from our mother.”

“That may be so, but the others, they’re stronger, bigger, faster,” Sycamore said.

“True, but you know your talents lie in other areas. You’re thoughtful, persistent, observant. Much more so than I see of the other boys and girls.”

“Then you regret it,” Sycamore said, “That you didn’t call my name to join the hunt.”

Jackdaw leveled him with a steady look. “Sycamore, it may be that you are talented, but we both know what talents are necessary for something as strenuous as the hunt. Pike speared the boar yesterday. Do you think you could have in his place? He’s tall, lean with muscle from tending flock every day. You’re a sure hand with the sling, I know, but studying and gardening with our mother hardly prepares you to hold a spear in the face of a boar’s charge.”

Sycamore grunted in response. He knew what Jackdaw said was true, but it confused him for his brother to call him talented with one breath and then dismiss him with the next. Of course, he understood the essence of his brother’s words. It was an echo of his mother’s daily encouragements. He only wished that his talents let him shine.

“Do you mean to say that I’m forever bound to be waiting in the village to tend to the heroes after they’ve returned home, glory seized in their hands?” 

“It’s no small honor to be trusted with healing, Sycamore. You know our mother is held in great regard by the clan.” Sycamore remembered the conversation between Jackdaw and his mother the night before. “But no, I don’t mean to imply such things. The purpose of this conversation is the opposite, in fact.”

They had walked a distance while talking, to a peaceful copse on the northern end of the village. Jackdaw came to a stop among the trees, turning to Sycamore.

“If you mean to say that one day I will become strong, do not waste your breath. Mother speaks like that often, and I have no plans to bide my time until strength comes to me,” Sycamore said. There was value to such thought, patience for strength, but his experience with Lupin that morning and his reflections over the hare’s corpse had driven him to swear off waiting.

Jackdaw laughed. “Our mother is wise. I am sure, even without what I suggest today, you would one day become a beacon of strength in the clan, enough so that even the terrible smith’s boy couldn’t bother you.” He paused at Sycamore’s shocked expression. “Come now, Sycamore. I may have told you to play nice with Lupin this morning, but I’m not so blind that I miss the boy’s defects. His father gave him that sword to encourage maturity, but I fear the day he unsheathes it in a fit of anger.” Sycamore resisted the urge to poke at the cut on his nose.

“As I was saying,” Jackdaw continued, “Our mother is wise, but I believe she forgets your youth. I understand, in the part of me that remembers my childhood, that your want of power is as natural as your want of food and drink. And now, I offer you a chance to earn that power.”

“What, then,” Sycamore asked, “You’ll train me to be stronger?”

Jackdaw hummed as he thought. “Yes,” He answered, “Train you, surely. But not to become stronger as you imagine. As part of this training, I’ll encourage you to exercise your body, but that will not be the focus of our lessons.”

“Well what do you wish to teach me?” Sycamore said, eagerness creeping into his voice.

Jackdaw smiled, sensing the boy’s excitement. “Tell me, Sycamore. What do you know of our clan’s art of Speaking with the Wind?”

Sycamore thought about it. “I’m not sure. Mother often speaks of listening to the wind, but never speaking with it. That sounds the purview of madmen and oracles.”

Jackdaw laughed. “Not to have a conversation with the wind, brother, but to let the wind speak through you,” He considered a moment. He placed a hand on his chest. “Your healing is an application of power, pulled from the body to remedy ails.” He shifted his hand, waving it around him, “to Speak with the Wind is, instead, to connect to the power of the wind, to use, strengthen, and direct it.”

Sycamore gave his brother a confused look, “You mean to say I can make wind?”

Jackdaw shook his head, “Not make it, no. When we speak with the wind, we cannot bring movement to stale air. We influence the wind, nudge it to listen to our will, but it is not our servant. Try to wrestle with its power and it will slip through your fingers, but allow yourself to be taken in by the breeze and you will be able to use it to your advantage.”

Sycamore became even more confused. “Is this some sort of lesson I’m not grasping about finding your place in the world? An extension of Mother’s vague instructions to listen to the wind?”

“No, I speak of something real.” Jackdaw’s smile widened. “I suppose a demonstration is in order.” 

He stuck a hand into the air, fingers spread. “A slight breeze,” He muttered. Sycamore felt it too, the flow of air on the back of his neck. “Like my breath, I will channel it through me.” Jackdaw began to move his hand in long, smooth motions. Around them, the wind began to increase in strength. As Jackdaw moved his arm faster, the wind, too, gained in speed. Sycamore, shocked, looked around him, searching for the cause of the airflow. In front of him, Jackdaw had begun using both arms and stepping with his movements. It was almost like a dance as he threw his arms around. The wind had risen to a gust, buffeting Sycamore from all sides. He raised his hands to cover his ears from the sound of it tearing around him. In a sudden movement, Jackdaw thrust his hands forwards, straight towards Sycamore. The wind came together in a single burst of motion, a gale that knocked Sycamore off his feet to the ground. With that, Jackdaw ceased in his movement, and so, too, did the wind cease. 

Sycamore lay on the ground, heart racing as he tried to comprehend what had just happened. Jackdaw approached him, extending a hand and helping him to his feet.

“Apologies, Sycamore, but I thought a demonstration of force would be the best way to pique your interest. Before I told you I would offer you the chance to grow stronger. I can teach you what I know of Speaking with the Wind. Would you like to learn?”
