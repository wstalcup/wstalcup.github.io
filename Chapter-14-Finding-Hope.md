_As we made our way further into the Kingdoms’ former lands, the boy became more and more curious about day to day life in a Kingdom city. It was mundane details, mostly. He would ask about everyday topics, like the use of money and familial relations, and then slip into things I consider to be far more interesting, like the status of mages and the mechanisms of warfare. Even in the way he asked questions, the boy proved fascinating._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

They sat in silent despondence, helplessness soaking through them like the rain, cold and unavoidable. Water dripped through the roof, a thick cloth stretched over a makeshift frame of wooden rods. Rough-hewn planks covered the muddy ground in a minimal attempt at a floor. Grime bubbled up through the cracks as Sycamore shifted his weight, vainly trying to get rid of the numbness he felt from remaining in the same position for hours.

“What do we do now?” Pike asked, voicing the question that hung over them like a storm cloud. Mrs. Maple’s money, though not enough to get them into the city, was more than enough to rent a pair of shacks. It was not nice lodging, but it was some shelter from the rain.

“We do what we should have from the beginning, pursue our clan and free them,” Lupin said. Sycamore, Lupin, and Pike sat with Gramps in one shanty while Mrs. Maple was with her children in the other.  

“We wouldn’t know where to begin in our pursuit. Besides, you agreed with us that coming east to Whitebrook was the best course of action,” Sycamore said irritably. He did not wish to argue, but Lupin’s incessant prattling prickled his nerves.

“I agreed to come to rally an army, not to be ignored and discarded.”

“We had no idea there would be so many refugees.”

“Had you known, would you have made a different decision? You act as if you decide with foresight, but really it is fear that guides your hand,” Lupin said with a scowl.

“You would follow after an army, pride demanding you throw yourself on the swords of the Fireglass pointlessly,” Sycamore protested.

“And you would do nothing as our clan is imprisoned and carted off somewhere only the wind can follow. Caution and plans mean nothing if they don’t lead to the freedom of our families. A cautious approach that leads nowhere is nothing but cowardice.”

“Caution is the only reason we still live!” Sycamore cried, “Do you think the Fireglass would have allowed us to simply follow on their heels after killing them at the vineyard? We are not soldiers, Lupin. Only luck and caution have kept us alive. To plan carefully was necessary.”

“And your plans have put ten days of distance between us and the chains that bind the Heartwood clan,” Lupin said with a scowl, “Here we sit at Whitebrook, but are we any closer to having our revenge? Where is our army? What was the point to coming here?”

Sycamore glared at Lupin, but he had no answers. He had not expected such destruction on the road, not expected to find Whitebrook awash with refugees. He’d left the Magus’s sanctum with new hope. That hope had waned as they walked past scenes of destruction, dwindled when came upon the shantytown, and been dashed to the last vestige when Administrator Moss turned them away at the edge of the city. He wondered himself why they had come here, whether there was not a better course to take.

A cruel silence hung in the air, questioning everything they’d done since the attack on the village. Pike broke it with a long sigh.

“I wonder how the flock is doing,” He said. Sycamore was caught off guard by the thought. The Fireglass had taken their clansmen, yes, but what of the livestock? He imagined himself as a sheep, left to wander the fields, ignorant of the fire and destruction that had upended his shepherds’ lives. It was a comforting thought.

“It will be a lot of work, rounding them up,” Sycamore said. Nearly ten days had passed since the raid. With that sort of time, he shuddered to think of how far they could roam.

“Trout and I will – will no doubt be stuck with the job,” He stuttered at the mention of his brother, and his voice trailed off, “When all this is over.”

“When all this is over,” Sycamore repeated. Such a thing was becoming increasingly difficult to imagine.

“What do we do now?” Pike asked again.

Despondent silence returned, interrupted only by the patter of the rain and the squelching of mud. Sycamore watched as Gramps stood, opening the panel of the lamp that hung at the top of their shack and lighting a thin strip of wood. He sat back down, lighting his pipe and inhaling deeply. A moment later a cloud of smoke flowed upward out of their shanty.

“Hope is a fickle thing,” The old man said, “In many ways, it is like the wind: to try to understand it is folly. It rises and falls at a moment’s notice, coming and going with a frustrating instability.” He paused to take another puff of his pipe. Sycamore smelled the tobacco when he breathed, felt the smoke burn his lungs. He stifled a cough as Gramps continued. “But still, even at its weakest, we can feel the wind brushing our faces. And if there is no wind about,” He waved a hand through the cloud of smoke that hovered around his head, scattering it, “we can make our own.”

“If there is wisdom couched in that nonsense, I can’t see how it applies to our current problems,” Lupin said. Gramps eyed the grumpy boy steadily, but offered no comment.

Sycamore stared at the cloud of smoke as it filtered upward and out the flap of their shelter. He tried to trace its path with his eyes, but seemingly without reason, the smoke would spin in some expected way. The meaning of Gramps’s words nudged at Sycamore’s understanding.

“Hope is fickle,” Sycamore muttered with a frown. He spoke again, louder, “I can tell you I felt no hope when I came upon a Fireglass raider standing above the charred timbers of my home, singing a song of death and destruction. Still, somehow, we made it here, with a hope for some resolution to this business of raiding and Fireglass.” 

“I fail to see your point,” Lupin said drily, “Unless you can spin silver out of naïve optimism, those hopes have been crushed.”

“Certainly it may seem that way now, but it seemed that way until I came upon you half-dead, and it seemed that way until we found others at the vineyard. Hope, like the wind, is fickle. If we bury our heads in the mud, we’ll be unable to feel the brush of a new breeze on our skin, unable to see when our next hope reveals itself.” Sycamore looked at Gramps. The old man inclined his head fractionally at Sycamore’s words.

“So we’re to wait for some benefactor to choose us? Some unseen ally to bring us the help we need?” Lupin said incredulously.

“Perhaps,” Sycamore said, watching that cloud of smoke swirl though the air. “And if that hope is insufficient-” Sycamore felt the movement of air in the drafty shelter, grabbed hold of it. With the flick of a finger and a surge of power, he sent the smoke out the front of their shack in a gust of air. “We’ll make our own.”

Night fell as Sycamore wove between groups of huts along the makeshift, muddy paths of the shantytown. His boots caught in the mud, and every step was a heavy, slurping effort. The rain had died to a drizzle, a thousand tiny patters on his cloak’s thick hood. Sounds of life surrounded him, laughter and conversation proving that joy can exist in even the dreariest of settings.

The atmosphere of their shack had become stifling after hours of sitting. At some point, Mrs. Maple had brought them the dinner that came with their lodging, a thin soup of foraged herbs. A handful of animal bones were thrown into the soup to add depth, but it remained nearly flavorless. They’d managed to avoid conflict while they ate, but when their meal was finished tempers returned. Not wishing to retread old arguments, Sycamore decided to take a walk to clear his head.

He was lost in his thoughts. Gramps’s words had sent his mind tumbling down the avenue of how to make their own hope. Lupin spoke too openly about things they had no control over, but he was right in that they could not let their efforts stall at the edge of Whitebrook. Jackdaw and his mother were imprisoned somewhere, and he had to find some way to help them.

But he did not know what he could do. He had no money, no connection to the council in Whitebrook. Should they give up on the city and, as Lupin wanted, pursue their clan north? To Sycamore, it seemed reckless. They had no information about where the Fireglass had taken their clan. And if they could somehow track them down, what would they do? Two times he had fought with his life on the line, and both times only luck and the help of his comrades had preserved him. If Lupin expected them to fight hundreds of trained soldiers and survive, he was simply delusional.

The other obvious option was to stay near Whitebrook and hope that some opportunity to enter the city would arise. From there, they would have to gain an audience with the council and successfully convince them to join in their pursuit of their clan’s freedom. Sycamore frowned. Even compared to Lupin’s plan, it sounded farfetched.

He paused at an intersection. The path split into three muddy offshoots. He chose one randomly on a whim, continuing his wandering through the sea of shaky structures. Others walked the paths as well, but few paid him any notice. Perhaps his cloak would draw eyes in other situations, but in the rain most who traversed the shantytown wore their hoods.

He listened as he walked, hoping for some inspiration from the overheard bits of conversation. The number of people around still baffled him, and each one had their own circumstances. Not much could be understood clearly. Most of what he heard was unfamiliar names and common expressions of frustration and disgust at the food. It was nearly identical to what they had talked about over dinner.

As he listened, an all-too familiar sound entered his ears. It took him a moment to isolate the sound, but he realized it was the sound of someone moaning in pain. It was an unsettling noise that pierced through much of the conversation. As he walked he noticed the sound slowly growing louder. He came to the next intersection and turned, mindlessly walking towards the sound. Instinct sent him towards it, honed over years of healing.

Sycamore followed the noise until he came to a particularly run-down shanty. A cloth was thrown over the entrance, obscuring his view, but it was clear that the noises of pain came from within. He hesitated for a moment before drawing the cloth to the side and sticking his head inside.

A man lay sprawled on a cot, head and shoulders propped on a pack. One arm was thrown across his head, covering his face; the other dangled over the side of the cot. One of his legs was propped up, resting on a folded cloak. His calf was wrapped in bandages, yellowed with pus and poultice. The air was thick with the smell of festering flesh.

The man writhed in pain, and another low moan escaped his lips. Sycamore paused only a moment before stepping fully into the shack. He could not just let the man lay here in suffering.

“Sockeye, iz’at you?” The man said, his words slurring, “You find me some drink?”

Sycamore felt a wave of awkwardness before forcing out a greeting, “My name is Sycamore,” He said.

Hearing an unfamiliar voice, the man moved the arm from his face, revealing himself to be middle aged. He peered at sycamore with a narrow glare. “Who are you and whadda’ya want? Come to gawk at a gimp’s pain?” He tried to prop himself up on his elbows, but winced at the movement and lay back down.

“My name is Sycamore,” Sycamore repeated, awkwardly adding “I’m a healer.” He pulled his hood down, and the man growled a curse when he saw Sycamore’s face.

“What’s a Westfolk – never mind. You say you’re a healer?”

“Yes. I heard you crying out in pain, and thought I might be able to help.”

The injured man studied him for a long moment, skepticism plain on his face.

“I just want to take a look,” Sycamore assured him, “My mother has taught me never to let someone in pain go untreated.” Another moment and the man nodded. Apparently, mention of Sycamore’s mother was enough to convince him.

“You best not be lying, boy. It’s an evil thing to give a man false hope.” Sycamore nodded. Now, more than ever, he understood the value of such things. “Well, come on then, tell me if you can help.”

Sycamore approached the man. He had never healed someone unknown to him, and he felt a bit awkward as he knelt down next to the man’s leg.

“So what happened?” Sycamore asked as he lifted the leg, slowly unwrapping the bandages from the wound. 

“Two weeks back, maybe, my village was raided. Some of us managed to get away, but one of the damned Fireglass got me in the calf with his spear. It wasn’t a deep cut, but it went yellow about a week back.” The man winced as the bandage pulled away from the wound , taking dried blood and pus with it. “My man, Sockeye, has some experience with treating injuries. He put a poultice of flax on the bandage, said it would help with the healing.”

Sycamore thought back to what his mother taught him of herbs. “Flax will help the swelling but not infection.” He frowned as he stared at the wound. It was infected, and had begun to go gangrenous. “Did you ever clean it?” He asked as he reached out with his Healer’s touch. He found the man’s essence easily. He seemed healthy and vibrant, despite the wound.

“I was on the road until I came here,” He said, “n’by that time it had already started oozing.”

Sycamore nodded. He looked up at the man with an awkward smile. “The good news is I can heal the wound,” Sycamore said, and the man visibly brightened. “But in order to do so, I have to cut away the rotting flesh. It will be very painful.” He pointed at the edge of the wound, “You see where it’s gone red here? I can’t heal that.” Even his mother was unable to heal dead flesh.

The man swallowed. He stared at the wound for a long while before looking back to Sycamore. “Will it heal if y’don’t take a knife to it?”

Sycamore shook his head, “Let it go like this much longer, and your leg will go completely gangrenous. You’ll lose it.”

The man worked his jaw for a moment before taking a heaving sigh. “Well, that settles it, then. Pain’s one thing, a leg’s another. What do I have to do?”

Sycamore considered a moment before responding, “The wound is on your calf, so I’ll need you to roll onto your stomach. Also, I recommend you find something to bite down on.” Sycamore had seen his mother do something like this exactly one time, two years before. An old farmer had cut his foot and hid the wound out of stubbornness. He was one of the most stoic men Sycamore had ever met, and he screamed like an infant as Sycamore’s mother scraped the rotten flesh away. The man heaved another sigh, but nodded, pulling his leather belt from his trousers and placing it in his mouth. Then, gingerly, he rolled onto his stomach

Sycamore stood up, placing his knee on the ankle of the injured leg. “Try not to jerk while I’m cutting,” Sycamore said, “I’ll try to hold your leg down, but I’m not very heavy. If you pull free from my control, my knife might slip and cut you worse, and I don’t want this to be any more painful than it has to.” The man grunted in understanding.

Sycamore took a deep breath, drawing his skinning knife from his waist. He was acting like an expert to this man, but in reality this was a far more intimidating healing than he had ever done by himself. He swallowed as he studied the wound, knife clutched in his hand. It was simple really, he had to cut away the dead flesh so he could heal what was still living.

The cut in the leg was not deep, nor particularly large. On one end it was puckered and pale like a normal wound, swollen at the edges, but no more than he would expect from a spear wound. On the other end the flesh was reddened, oozing a yellow gel at the edges, a sign that the flesh was rotting on his body. It looked wrong and stank horribly. The longer he looked at the grotesque wound, the more he wanted to look away, to flee the festering air of the shack.

But he had given this man hope, and that was a commitment he could not break.

“I’m going to start cutting now,” Sycamore said. The man grunted in reply, and Sycamore felt the muscles in the leg tense up. He leaned his full weight onto the man’s ankle, hopefully preventing any sudden movements. He took a deep breath, brought the knife next to the wound, and started to cut.

He worked in quick sawing motions, scraping away the flesh as quickly as he could without losing precision. He felt the man writhing under his knife, twitches and spasms of the muscle as he sliced through the man’s calf. Halfway through, he realized he needed to clean his knife, wiping it off on the cot. He returned his knife to the wound, continuing to saw around the dead flesh as fresh blood pooled in the wound. He didn’t blink, didn’t breath as he cut, feeling the man strain against his weight. The man’s instincts must have been roaring at him to move, to get out of this agony. Sycamore was so focused that he did not notice the man’s other foot shoot up in a reflexive motion. The man’s heel slammed into the side of Sycamore’s head, and he let out a piercing scream of pain as the leather belt fell from his mouth. It was all Sycamore could do not to lose his grip on the knife. Somehow, though he kept his balance and finished cutting away the rotten flesh, ignoring the man’s screams as he finished his work. He cast the knife to the side and, finally, with a deep breath, pulled the man’s soul through his body to the wound, watching as it sealed in front of his eyes.

He sat back in a heap, falling onto his rear. His heart was racing from the pressure of the moment, and he rubbed at where the man kicked his head, the pain finally setting in.

On the cot, the man had rolled over and sat up. He was poking at where the wound had been, staring wide eyed at the newly healed skin. Eventually, he looked at Sycamore where he sat exhausted on the ground.

“Thank you,” He said. “I mean, damn you that was painful, but that I’m all healed up – Thank you.”

“I’m just doing what my mother would want,” Sycamore said, rubbing at his sore jaw. A thought occurred to him. “And thank you.”

“What could you be thanking me for?” The man asked.

“For trusting me with your hope,” Sycamore said with a grin.

The man studied him for a moment before throwing his head back and laughing loudly.

“You’re a strange boy, you know that?” He said when his laughter had subsided, “But I s’pose I should’ve expected s’much when a cloaked Westfolk lad poked his head in m’shack with an offer to heal me.” He reached into his bag. “M’name’s Cottonmouth, by the way,” The man said as he pulled out a heavy looking pouch. “It’s a pleasure to meet ya, Sycamore. Now, how much do I owe you for m’leg?” He shook the pouch, and Sycamore heard metal jingling.

Sycamore blinked. He had never been asked anything like this before. Was his healing worth money? As far as he knew, no one ever paid his mother to heal them. But then, as far as Sycamore could tell, she had strange views on money compared to most outside of the Heartwood clan. He thought about what his mother would say if she heard he was taking money for healing, and he winced. Even her imagined scoldings were fierce.

Before he could refuse though, someone whipped the cloth door to the side and stepped into the shack. It was another middle-aged man, carrying a bottle of what looked like alcohol in his hand.

“Cottonmouth, are you okay? I thought I heard a scream a moment ago. I found you some booze, but...” His voice trailed off as he looked from Cottonmouth, who was experimentally testing his leg as he walked around the shack, to Sycamore, who still sat on the ground as he considered the issue of money.

“Sockeye, you’ll never believe it! M’friend Sycamore here showed up and healed my leg!” Cottonmouth grinned at his friend.

Sockeye soundlessly moved his mouth for a moment as his eyes darted between Sycamore, Cottonmouth, and the pouch of money in Cottonmouth’s hand. Finally, he said, “My mother was burnt badly, and the blisters on her back are slow to mend. Can you heal her? I can pay – not much, but something.”

Sycamore thought a moment before nodding. “Let me take a look. I might be able to help you out,” He said. He paused for a though, and then added, “But first, your friend Cottonmouth was about to pay me for my healing, so give me a moment and we can go to your mother.”

Perhaps Sycamore’s mother would not look kindly on taking money for healing, but she was not there to complain. She was captured by the Fireglass, imprisoned with the rest of his clan, so Sycamore had little choice but to take the chance offered to him. Sycamore smiled. It was a small thing, but he swore he could feel the beginnings of a breeze on his cheek.
