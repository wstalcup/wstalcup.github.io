_As the boy warmed to us, he began to speak on his origins. He claimed to be raised by halflings, and spoke fondly of his family and clan. I asked of their whereabouts and wellbeing, but he seemed hesitant to answer. I do not know if that hesitance came from a lack of trust or something darker. He seemed troubled by his own identity, which I empathized with. My own origins, I spared him. There was tragedy there, as well as a history between our peoples he likely knew nothing of._

An excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

-----

When the truth of Loam’s death was finally announced, there was outrage in the Heartwood clan.

Sycamore’s days since agreeing to the Magus’s tutelage had passed in a whirlwind of studies and training. He spent his afternoons in the Magus’s sanctum, the booming voice drilling him on concepts of the soul, speaking on arcane ideas with overwhelming speed and complexity. Following those lessons, he would meet with Jackdaw, practice in his Speaking, and ask his brother on particularities of their clan’s magical arts.

He quickly noticed some fundamental differences between his two teachers. Where Jackdaw relied on feeling and instinct, the Magus spoke with an academic rigor that demanded attention to detail and full understanding of the subject matter. Sycamore could not choose which style of lesson he preferred, but both served as an adequate distraction from the increasingly tense atmosphere.

Weeks had passed since the murder. Sycamore saw signs of ill-ease in the quickness of his mother’s temper, the constant frown on his normally good-humored brother’s face. He knew there must be some disagreement on the council, and others in the clan were beginning to catch on. With the tension came questions from around the clan, questions of what was happening and why the situation was so shrouded in secret. Even Trout and Pike, normally immune to such things, had approached him and asked if he knew anything. He’d kept his oath to secrecy, telling them he knew nothing. It felt sour in his stomach, lying to his friends, but he had decided to trust the council’s judgement, and they told him it was not his business.

Finally, that evening, a gathering had been called. They announced that a hunt would be held a week hence. And then they announced that Loam had been murdered. The immediate reaction was one of shock. His clansmen demanded more detail, demanded to know why the truth had been concealed so long. Jackdaw, speaking for the council, had deferred most questions until after the gathering, answering a bare few in the presence of the whole clan. Yes, they knew with certainty Loam was killed. No, they did not know who was responsible. No, they had not told Juniper. The last felt wrong to Sycamore, but they said they wished not to burden the young woman with such heavy knowledge.

Eventually, the gathering had been brought to a close. Many members of their clan lingered to ask more questions, to discuss and argue over the Heartwood’s best course of action. Sycamore did not remain. His reaction to the announcement was different. He sighed in relief when he heard Jackdaw speak of Loam’s murder. Finally, he could speak of his fears to his friends, finally the burden of the looming threat was shared with his clan. So he found himself, with Trout and Pike, discussing the gathering and the new knowledge of the threat.

“Do you think a war will come?” Pike asked in a hushed voice. The threat was now common knowledge, but still, speaking of violence and war felt taboo. They sat in a small circle on the outskirts of the village, just out of hearing range of the council’s shouted debate.

“I hope not,” Trout said, “Pa once told me that the only glory to be found in war is from ending it to build peace.” He poked at the ground with a stick, tracing patterns in the dirt.

Sycamore nodded, “That idea is shared among many of our clan, I believe. We came here, you know, to escape war.”

“Our parents don’t often speak of their childhoods, but when they do it’s with frowns and sad voices,” Pike said.

“War hurts, even in memory,” Sycamore said, echoing the Magus’s words.

They lingered on that thought, each consumed by their own reflection and premonition, until a familiar, grating voice broke the silence.

“The trio, again. No doubt discussing the runt’s stroke of luck,” Lupin called out to them, a sneer in his voice. He approached, followed by a group of his own followers. “I guess all it took for you to be invited to the hunt was the death of our clansman. I offer you my congratulations.” His followers snickered at his jab, though Sycamore saw no humor. It was true that with the way the hunt was announced by Jackdaw, Sycamore would be included. Considering the circumstances, he barely noticed.

“Ease off the insults, Lupin,” Trout said, “It’s hardly the time.”

The boy feigned innocence. “I mean no insult with my words! Simple congratulations that you could be so lucky.”

“If you call it luck that Loam is dead, then your priorities are twisted,” Sycamore said. He had no patience for the boy’s taunts, not with the atmosphere as it was.

Lupin and his cronies stepped up close, looming over where Sycamore sat on the ground. “Not luck for him or me, runt, but for you. Luck that Loam would die, rendering the hunt to the north necessary to scout and take stock. Luck that you were there to haul the body back, time to plan and plot. Luck that your mother asked your aid in examining the body. Luck that you helped to identify it as murder, not simple accident.” 

Sycamore rose to his feet, tension building in his muscles. The scar on his nose was reminder that he could not fight the boy evenly, no matter how much he had grown in strength since then. And before, Lupin was alone, not flanked by snickering accomplices. Trout and Pike would defend him, need be, but he was tired of relying on them.

“What are you accusing me of, Lupin?”

“Only good luck, Runt. I don’t believe even you would stoop so low as to have your mother and brother make a murder of an accident, sending the village to panic over some phantom threat just to get enough recognition to join a hunt. And to wait until after the cremation, so your claims could not be verified. That would be too villainous, even for one so close to dirt as you,” his words came out almost as a growl, a threat as much as an accusation.

“You go too far, Lupin,” Pike said, “Even you aren’t dull enough to accuse the Head of orchestrating this. You saw the arrow they found.”

“I saw an arrow yes, but there’s little to suggest its origin. Perhaps someone dropped it in the wilds, a component of this ruse of a murder,” Lupin said, predatory eyes not leaving Sycamore, “I smelled something filthy in this situation, and when I follow filth back to its source, I always find the runt.”

Sycamore felt his temper flaring. Lupin’s accusations made no sense. The thought that Sycamore might cook up a whole scheme for something so small as the recognition of joining the hunt was insanity, Lupin had to know that. It angered Sycamore, that when Lupin needed someone to taunt, he came to Sycamore. A month ago, Sycamore had fallen for the bait, his scar was proof. He would not do so again, not suffer the pain and shame of before.

But he was not the Sycamore of before. He took a deep breath, centering himself. Around him, he felt the cool evening breeze. It blew past him, fluttering through his hair. Sycamore breathed deeply, and his breath joined the wind. He felt it, the thrum of power that came with that connection. He did not seize that power, for with such aggression it would only flit away through his fingers. Instead, he urged it slowly to move how he wished, like coaxing a stubborn mule. He felt it cycling through his legs, slowly gaining in speed.

“Well, runt?” Lupin said, “Care to defend yourself? Or shall I take your silence as a confession.”

With a sudden jerk of his arm, Sycamore whipped the wind across the eyes of Lupin and his cronies. It was a gust, not enough to knock them back, but enough to blind for a moment. Lupin slapped a hand at his eyes, blinking to obscure the sudden wind. While he was blinded, Sycamore stepped forward, shoving Lupin to the ground and turning to sprint away.

“Run!” Sycamore called to Trout and Pike, who were staring confused at the boys in front of them, all suddenly scratching at their eyes. Following Sycamore’s lead, the twins took off at a sprint after him. Behind, they heard the others yelling taunts and insults after them.

Moments of running later, they were safely away from Lupin and his followers, out of breath but out of danger.

“You’ll have to explain what you did one day,” Pike said between gasps of breath, “but for now, I’ll just cherish the memory of seeing Lupin knocked on his rear.” 

What he had done was not much compared to what he suffered at Lupin’s hands, but he had done it with his own power. Despite himself and the situation of the village, Sycamore couldn’t help but laugh.

-----

Dinner that evening was quiet. Hours after the gathering’s conclusion the clan had argued themselves to exhaustion, and Sycamore’s mother and brother finally returned home. Sycamore, expecting their lateness, had prepared a meal for them, a stew of beans and grains.

“Jackdaw tells me you grow quickly in your Speaking,” Sycamore’s mother said. It was rare for her to acknowledge their lessons at all, rarer still for her to speak of Speaking. A side effect, maybe, of the tumultuous situation.

“He does,” Jackdaw confirmed, “He learns much quicker than I did. Soon, perhaps, he will be the one giving me lessons.” Jackdaw laughed. With that evening’s gathering, he looked more at ease than he had in weeks. Sycamore had felt relief at the announcement, and the pressure on him was little compared to what Jackdaw must have felt. It was good to see his humor return.

“You exaggerate, Jackdaw. Whatever skill I show is only thanks to your teaching,” Sycamore said, though he reveled in the praise.

“Flattery will earn you nothing from me,” Jackdaw said, “But go on, Sycamore, tell our mother of your newfound strength.”

Sycamore grinned, “Well, just today, Lupin was up to his usual taunts, attempting to ruin my day. But with my Speaking, I was able to turn the situation around, give him a taste of his own treatment and get away easily.”

In front of him, Jackdaw winced. Their mother paused in her eating, turning to Sycamore.

“You mean to tell me that you used your Speaking in violence against a member of our clan?” She asked in a low, severe voice.

Sycamore scrambled to explain, “I simply used it to protect myself. You should have heard some of what he said, mother, he was accusing-”

“I don’t care about his words Sycamore,” Her voice rose. She turned to Jackdaw. “You said you wished to grow closer to him, so I allowed you to conduct these lessons. What have you been telling him, that he uses his abilities to bully?”

“I used my abilities in defense, Mother!” Sycamore said, “Jackdaw is a fine teacher, do not blame him for my actions.”

“Then it is you who takes responsibility?” She said, “Defense you call it, lashing out in anger against a member of our clan. Even now, after Loam’s death reminds us of what lies outside the Heartwood, you do so?”

“You do not understand, Mother, the way Lupin torments me. He’s stronger than me, hurts me. He deserves-”

“We are not discussing the Aivis boy’s actions, Sycamore, nor what he deserves. You suffer under him, yet still you act this way. You fault him for using his strength to torment you, yet the moment you have strength of your own, cause suffering for him. Do you not see the hypocrisy of that? How are you better than him?”

“What I did to him is little in the face of what he does to me,” Sycamore yelled. He felt tears pooling in the corners of his eyes. His actions nothing compared to Lupin. Finally, he’s able to defend himself, and his mother scolds him for it?

“For now you remain relatively weak, yes. But what will you do when you gain strength? Will you use it to dominate him, lash out in abuse? I will not see my son become a bully and a tyrant!”

“Enough, Mother!” Jackdaw snapped, “Sycamore misstepped, yes, but you speak too harshly. The gathering was draining for both of us, let us finish our food in peace. We can talk of such things tomorrow.”

Sycamore’s mother stared at him for a moment, but he did not meet her gaze. It hurt, knowing that his mother thought such things of him. It hurt more, knowing there was a nugget of truth to her words. It felt good to finally win one over Lupin, and the thought of being able to do so again, with more strength, allured him.

Finally she spoke again, “I’ve lost my appetite.” She stood up, and turned to leave the house. Before she left the room, she turned back to Sycamore. “I’m disappointed, my Sapling.”

Jackdaw sighed heavily after she left. He spoke to Sycamore in soothing tones, “You have to understand, Sycamore, that our mother abhors violence above all else.”

“What I did to Lupin today hardly counts as violence,” Sycamore protested, “But she would not even let me explain.”

“To her, even the suggestion of such brings back harsh memories. I know you would not do something to cause undue pain, even to Lupin, and she must as well. But she hears the same things as I from the wind. Pain and danger approach us. Perhaps your words today reminded her that you may be a part of it, if only to defend the clan.” He rose, moving to follow their mother. “I will speak to her on your behalf.”

Jackdaw left the house, leaving Sycamore alone to brood over his meal. To be honest, he had lost his appetite as well.

The mason nodded, and Sycamore’s mother jerked on his arm to set the bone. The big man whined around the length of rope clenched between his teeth. It was extremely painful, setting the bone, but necessary for proper healing. To skip the step would heal the arm misshapen, perhaps with permanent pain.

“I’m healing you now,” Sycamore said, carefully pulling the man’s essence to the fracture. It required much power to heal such a wound, and Sycamore closely watched the transfer from the essence. Too much drawn, the man could be rendered comatose, or worse, dead. 

It was interesting, to heal with the new perspective the Magus’s teachings. The Magus described the soul as a well of energy within the person, to be accessed carefully and sparingly. There was the weight of experience and warning in his words, but also vanity. He spoke with a possessiveness of his power that he earned after years of study and practice. To him, soul magic was to take power from the soul and wield it. Sycamore’s mother taught differently, that you were giving purpose to the power, not wielding it but directing it to repair. Her teachings mirrored many of Jackdaw’s descriptions of Speaking.

When the process was finished, the man nodded thanks. “Thank you as usual, Poppy, Sycamore.” He flexed his arm, rubbing at his wrist. “The bone seems to itch,” He muttered.

“Be more careful next time. That our healing becomes usual is a problem,” Sycamore’s mother said. The mason was a clumsy man, and frequently hurt himself with one of his tools.

“Come, Sycamore,” His mother said. The pair left the mason’s house in silence. They had not yet spoken of the previous night’s argument. Sycamore had fallen asleep before his mother returned, and that morning they had eaten in silence.

“I apologize, Sapling, for my harsh words,” His mother said, “I was tired, and-” She hesitated.

“Disappointed,” Sycamore finished.

She turned to him, nodding with a light smile, “Yes, disappointed. In my mind, you see, I thought you incapable of violence. To hear otherwise was a shock.” It rankled to hear his actions against Lupin described as violence, but he did not want to argue over that point.

“Why do you detest it with such intensity, mother?” Sycamore said, “Violence, I mean.”

“Is it not enough that I don’t like to see others in pain?” She asked.

“But your hatred of it seems to beyond a normal dislike of fighting,” Sycamore said, “You disdain power, and even the idea of violence seems to upset you.”

His mother paused in her walking, and Sycamore saw the hesitance on her face. Finally, she sighed. She spoke in a low voice, heavy with memory and pain.

“You know, of course, that our clan fled warfare to come here. You know, too, that I am a Priestess of the Wind. What you may not know is that ours is but a fragment of the Heartwood clan. Far to the east, far past the city of Whitebrook, the original Heartwood clan lives. They are known, mainly, for war making. Above all, they valued strength. Strong Speakers in the clan marched to battle, guiding arrows with wind into the hearts of our enemies. I used to be one of those leaders. I marched, at the front of a band of warriors, to war with other clans. In Speaking, I am gifted with strength, and I used that strength to kill.” She looked at Sycamore, and he saw pain in her eyes. Painful, even in memory. 

She continued, “You know, Sycamore, that aside from Speaking, I am also gifted with the ability to heal. So I would march to battle, slay others, and then observe the results of our war. I saw too much blood and bone, too many maimed friends. Of course, not all damage can be mended. I watched many die, too far gone to recover, or waiting for me to heal them. It began to twist me at my core. I could not sleep, for nightmares of screams and death. I could not eat, the food tasting of blood and rot. I could scarcely live with the phantoms that haunted me. So, one day, I simply stopped. I refused to fight anymore. Many saw it as weakness and betrayal, that others would die because of my frailty. Our ability to heal is unique, you know, Sycamore. In all my years I’ve met no others who share it. Many of the old Heartwood clan begged me to march with them once more, to heal them so they could stand up and once again leap into battle. I always refused.”

She turned away, continuing their walk back home, “Our Heartwood clan here are those who agreed with my hatred of battle. We sought to escape the wars of our Clan. But our enemies were many, and we feared their vengeance, so we fled west, far enough that none pursued us. We kept the name as a reminder of where we started, but cast off the violence of those days.”

Sycamore did not know how to respond. He could not imagine his mother as a warrior, let alone at the head of a warband. But still, he understood what she was saying. Even Sycamore, in his limited experience with healing had a sense of reverence about pain and death. He saw, many times, the suffering of people in pain and felt each time the desire to heal. He shuddered to think of what he would feel on the battlefield, surrounded by suffering friends.

His mother laughed a sad laugh. “You must think me a hypocrite, to scold you for your small act of violence when I have such a history behind me. I regret those times, and they continue to haunt me even all these years later.”

Sycamore considered for a moment before responding. “Trout and Pike told me of a saying of their Pa, that when all’s accounted for, you often find a mistake becomes a lesson.”

She smiled. “Yes, they often boast of his wisdom. You’re saying then, that the mistakes I made have become a lesson?”

“That’s what it seems to me. A lesson so large that you wanted to spread it to Jackdaw and me. I can forgive you for that,” Sycamore said, and his mother laughed. Curiosity burned in him, and he wanted to ask his mother for more stories of her past. But seeing the sadness in her eyes, hearing her tired voice, he couldn’t bring himself to ask of anything too painful. 

“You said our ability to heal is unique, right? Who did you learn to heal from?”

“My father,” She said, “I don’t speak of him much because I have few fond memories. He was prone to anger, often taken by dark moods. When I was born, my mother bled heavily, and when he healed her, her essence was overdrawn and she was put into a coma until she died. I think it affected him deeply.”

“Was he also a healer in battle?” Sycamore asked.

She shook her head. “He taught me to heal, but told me to keep my ability a secret. As far as I know, I was the only person who knew he had the ability. I assume his father taught him, but he never told me. He seemed to treat the ability as a burden, teaching me to preserve the knowledge but wanting little to do with the expectations that came with it. Of course, eventually I saw that he was right, in a way, when the clan’s elders demanded I heal the soldiers to make more war. If he was still alive, he would have boasted to me that his warnings proved true.” She frowned lightly at the thought before shaking her head. “But the past is the past, let’s not dwell on such darkness.”

“For what it’s worth, Mother, I think this ability to heal is a gift, not a burden,” Sycamore said. She reached out a hand, ruffled his hair.

“I’m happy that I’m able to teach you. It was a shock when you proved capable, especially after Jackdaw was unable to learn, but I’m happy the skill will be preserved in you. Much good can be done with our ability, Sycamore, or at least I think that clumsy mason would say so.”

Sycamore hummed thoughtfully. “Perhaps he would better learn his lesson if we didn’t heal him each time, clumsy as he is.” 

“I suspect without us, he would not survive the month,” His mother said, and they both laughed. Soon, they returned home, and made to prepare lunch. They spoke while working.

Sycamore’s mother talked as she sliced some bread. “I’m sorry, again, for my harshness yesterday, but I hope you begin to understand where It comes from. You and I share many strengths, and I was afraid to see myself in you, Sycamore. Not me as I am now, but as I was those years ago, wreathed in pain and destruction. Violence comes to the Heartwood clan once again, Sycamore. I can hear it in the wind. Promise me that you will not let it consume you like it once consumed me.”

Sycamore swallowed. He enjoyed the power of Speaking, and felt he was growing stronger quickly. But his mother’s dark memories told him that to grow too enamored with that strength would only lead to pain.

“I promise.”
