_I first came across the boy on a sunny autumn morning, far from anywhere resembling civilization. He was perched on a rock aside the road, curiously watching me as I made my way towards him. Immediately I was wary. It was a common highwayman’s ruse, you see, to use a situation demanding compassion as bait for an ambush – an injured traveler, a broken-cartwheel. I’d never seen such using a child, but the villainy of bandits leaves little to the imagination. These suspicions faded quickly when he addressed me with the wide, earnest eyes of a child’s curiosity. No bandit, child or otherwise, was still so innocent._

An Excerpt from _My History, Memoirs of a Historian_

------

Sycamore tried his very best not to be sullen as he tracked the hare. His mother had warned him that he may not be invited on the hunt, despite tradition. It seems tradition loses its importance when dealing with a runt. 

He had spotted the hare’s nest soon after fleeing from the morning’s gathering. Embarrassment had driven him out when the Head had finished announcing the names of those invited on the first hunt of the year. Sycamore’s name had not been called. For those his age, on their fourteenth spring, it was ceremony, a formality to accept new adults into the clan. Trout and Pike, two of Sycamore’s only friends, had grinned from ear to ear upon hearing their names. Now, they were no longer children. Sycamore was not sure where that left him.

Dew still clung to the grass as he searched for the telltale signs of a hare’s passing: padded footprints in the mud, disturbed grass, fresh droppings. His eyes may not be as sharp as others from his clan, but they worked well enough to hunt a hare. 

He’d never had any illusion that he was normal. From a young age, his eyes had been weak, his hands, slow, his arms, frail. For a long time he had at least kept up in height, but even that had changed, as in the previous summer the other children his age had seemingly sprung up overnight, like weeds in his mother’s herb garden. Trout and Pike, once the same height as Sycamore, now stood a full head taller than him.

He followed the hare to the hills, where the terrain became rocky and harder to track in. Still, a lack of patience and persistence were not two of Sycamore’s faults, and he was able to carry on in his pursuit. 

The other children often spoke ill of Sycamore, said he was emotionless, that his eyes had no light. His mother always said he shined in different ways, but even Trout and Pike told him it was sometimes hard to tell how he was feeling by looking at his face. Sycamore didn’t understand it; he frowned hard when he was sad, smiled wide when he was happy, and laughed loud when something was funny, but still they said his face was like a statue’s.

His breath caught when he spotted the hare. It was between two hills, drinking from a brook. It was a large hare, with dusky brown fur well suited to line winter clothing. He slowly approached his game, taking care with his steps not to break any twigs or disturb any silt and create noise. He stepped up to a small overhang, a ledge overlooking the brook and his prey. Meanwhile, he undid the sling bound around his waist.

Sycamore’s sling was his hope for success. At a young age, he decided that if he could not compare to others with physical strength, he would do so with skill. He was not strong enough to wield the spears or bows most in his clan favored, but he did not need much strength to hunt with a sling. So he practiced with it endlessly, until the flaxen cords left rough calluses on his hands.

He grabbed a small stone off the ground, taking a moment to feel its weight before he tucked it into his sling’s cradle. In honor of his fourteenth year, his mother had given him a longer, more powerful sling in silent support of his efforts. With a sling this size, he could bring down a stag.

In a slow, practiced motion, he began to whirl the sling. As it gained speed in rotation, he heard the stone fly past his ear with a rush of air. It was almost frightening how much damage it could do when launched. Seeing the broken skull of the first rabbit he’d ever hunted had shocked him. He had never used this particular sling to hunt, but he’d been practicing since the day his mother gave it to him. He felt a sense of grotesque anticipation at the harm it would cause.

As the sling came up to speed, excitement grew in the pit of his stomach to replace the morning’s shame. He had left the clan’s gathering embarrassed, but he would return with meat. A hare was not worth gloating over, but it was only the start. He’d show them, day by day, that he’s capable of hunting. A hare today, a deer tomorrow, a boar after that. 

He loosed the stone, and with it his hopes. It hurtled through the air with a quiet huff of wind, and he smirked as it struck the animal. His smirk faded when he realized he’d missed his mark, the hare’s head, instead hitting its leg. 

The small animal let out an ungodly cry as it attempted, with one shattered leg, to hobble off. It was not a wound the animal would survive, even if Sycamore didn’t track it and end its pain. Eager to gather his game and spare the animal a slow, painful death, Sycamore scrambled to follow it. In a moment of carelessness, he lost his footing on the rocky ground, slipping and falling forward. The world spun as he fell off the overhang, eventually coming to a painful landing on his hands and knees below. He felt a rush of embarrassment, thankful that no one had seen his tumble. He sat back and examined his hands, which were raw from the landing. Small pebbles dug into his skin. For days his palms would be pockmarked with painful reminders of his haste.

But this was no time for regret; he still had a hare to catch. He made to rise, pushing off the ground, but a sharp pain in his left leg immediately sent him sprawling back to the ground. Sycamore felt a dizzying moment of shock when he saw a shard of stone protruding from his leg, just above the knee. He poked at the wound and had the sickening realization that it had cut deep into his thigh, at least the length of his pointer finger. Dark blood oozed from the wound, staining his trousers. His experience in dressing wounds helped him resist the urge to yank the stone out, knowing that would likely tear open the wound and tremendously increase the bleeding. He also resisted the second urge to slowly pull the thing out and use his healing to seal the puncture wound. On another person, he could probably pull it off, but it was strictly forbidden to heal injuries on your own body. He’d heard enough horror stories to know breaking that rule was not an option.

Sycamore looked off in the direction the hare had hobbled, trying his best to suppress the pain in his leg and weigh his options. He needed to catch that hare. He could hardly call this his path to the future if he stumbled on the first step. He tested his leg gingerly as he stood up, wincing at the pain when he tried to put weight on it. He could stand, barely, and maybe limp, but the hare could continue for hours before the trauma and internal bleeding from the wound ended its life. His stomach sunk when he realized that, in his current state, he couldn’t follow. He was at least an hours walk outside of the village, and that was without a shard of stone stuck in his leg. There was only one smart choice.

He slowly turned back towards the village, wincing with every step. Desperately, he tried to keep that same sense of excitement and optimism he’d felt when he finally spotted the hare. Today might not be the day he proved himself to his clan, but there was always tomorrow. He spotted a thicket and made his way towards it, hoping to find a stick to use as a crutch. As it was, every step he took was a jolt of pain up his side. As he limped back towards the village, Sycamore tried his very best not to be sullen.

-----

The slap across his face momentarily distracted him from the deep throbbing pain in his leg. Midday had since passed by the time Sycamore made it back to the village, and his left trouser leg was soaked through with blood. His underarm had been scraped raw from leaning on his makeshift crutch, an oblong branch he’d found on the ground. On his belt was a bag of dewberries, picked in the same thicket he’d found his crutch. Sycamore had been determined not to return to the village empty handed.

“What were you thinking?” His mother snapped. She’d found him on the outskirts of the village. One of the shepherd boys had spotted him and fetched her. She’d come to Sycamore in rare disarray, her long brown hair and normally neat clothes a mess after running from their house. Her face had been wrinkled with worry, adding to the ever-present wrinkles of age. When she realized Sycamore wasn’t about to fall over and die, those worry wrinkles became anger wrinkles. She dragged him bodily back to their home, ignoring his pained whimpers on each step. The slap had come after they crossed the threshold and shut the door behind them.

“Well?” She demanded as she lifted him onto the raised bench she used to examine patients.

“I was just-” Sycamore began.

“I’ll tell you what you were thinking. Nothing. Running off this morning only to come back looking like this.” She pulled out a knife from her belt, deftly cutting away his trouser leg. She paused to examine the wound. The narrow shard of pale rock jutted from his leg, just above his left knee. It looked eerily like a bone, sticking out like that. The skin around the wound was puffy, inflamed. It puckered at the edges of the puncture. Sycamore swallowed sickly. It was much more difficult to ignore the pain when he got a good look at it.

“And how did this happen?” His mother asked as she wiped away blood and grime with a damp towel. “Lay back on the bench.” Sycamore did as he was told.

“I wanted-” 

“You wanted to prove yourself, after you were not invited to the hunt. Foolish boy, you probably were determined to hunt something on your own – a badger or hare, no doubt. A missed step and this is what you earned. Where did you fall?” She lifted his leg, prodding it gently. Sycamore winced but held in the whimper.

“The rocky hills, to the south, I tracked a hare to a brook. Killed it, too, but lost my footing,” Sycamore said. 

She continued after a moment, “It’s in there deep, but lucky for you it didn’t hit the bone, else you’d not have made it halfway back to the village. I’ve warned you again and again to be careful on those rocks, but I suppose warnings are forgotten when your simple pride is on the line. Let’s hope there are no barbs that will tear the flesh as I remove the rock. Either way, this will hurt. Look away.”

He dutifully looked up at the thatched roof of their home, wincing at the strange, painful sensation of his mother slowly removing the shard of stone. After an excruciating moment the sensation ended, and Sycamore looked back down at his leg. Now that the stone was gone, blood gushed freely from his leg onto his mother’s hands and the bench.

“I don’t see any other pieces of stone in there. If there are any, they’re likely too small to cause lasting harm. I’m going to heal you now. Brace yourself.” She held his leg firmly in place with one hand and placed the other overtop the wound.

A shiver ran down Sycamore’s back as he felt the healing begin. The sensation of the wound closing was strange, itchy, but not painful. Healing was unpleasantly draining, and Sycamore always felt short a night’s sleep when it finished. Two night’s, when the wound was this large.

After a moment, the healing finished, and Sycamore rubbed his hands together. It had also fixed the scrapes on his palms and inner arm, and they itched with the process. 

“Thank you, Mother,” Sycamore dutifully said. He knew that there was nothing to be done but be polite until she finished scolding him. 

“And where is it, then?” She asked, making eye contact.

“Where is what?”

“The hare. You said you killed it, did you not?”

Sycamore swallowed and looked away. “I broke its leg with my sling. It’s probably dead by now, but at the time I couldn’t very well pursue it.”

“All this for nothing, then” She muttered before continuing, “Well, at least you were not fool enough to put pride before health. Much wiser than some of your clansmen. Here.”

Sycamore turned back to his mother, and she placed the bloody shard of rock in his hand.

“Keep this as a reminder of those priorities. Pride is important, my sapling, but more important is that you are able to come home to me each night.” The look in her eyes had softened.

Sycamore felt a pang of hunger and was reminded, suddenly, of the dewberries he had picked. He opened the pouch, looked inside. The berries were minorly crushed, but were still plenty edible.

“Here,” He said, handing the pouch of berries to his mother. “Take this as a reminder that your son, even in humiliating defeat, will not return empty handed.”

She smiled lightly, looking at the berries. “Yes, dewberries certainly are a sweeter prize than a hare. We’ll spread them on bread with some smoked meat for an afternoon snack. The wind speaks to me and says you must be hungry after missing lunch.”

“You do always teach me to listen to the wind,” Sycamore said, swinging his legs over the edge of the bench and hopping off. He tested his left leg and was relieved to feel it had returned to workable strength. 

“Come now, your leg is fine. We’ll eat after you change your trousers and help me clean up this mess.” She gestured to the bloody floor and bench, “It’s your blood, after all.”

The members of his clan always said healing was a miracle, but he often failed to appreciate it. Of course, his mother insisted that she was the miracle, not the healing. He never protested.

-----

By the time they had finished cleaning the blood, Sycamore’s joy over having his leg healed had faded and been replaced by that same moodiness from the morning. He threw his ruined trousers into the bin they kept for used bandages and soiled clothing – they would be burned with the evening fire.

“What do you think the hunters are doing?” he asked as he snapped his makeshift crutch into kindling.

“I would imagine hunting,” His mother replied while scrubbing her hands with the tallow and lye soap they used to clean bloodstains. The stuff burned Sycamore’s hands whenever he used it, but his mother’s skin was numb to it after years of regular use.

“Do you think they will come back with a boar?” It was a prized occasion, when the hunters managed to bring back a boar, and it meant feasting. Sycamore had often dreamed of striking one with his sling.

“Doubtful,” His mother replied, “Boars don’t wander far from their shelters this early in the year.”

He piled up the now shorter pieces of wood in the corner of their home, with the other firewood.

“Mother,” Sycamore said hesitantly, “Do you think the Head is right? Am I not strong enough to join them on the hunt?”

She finished her scrubbing, taking a long moment to dry her hands before replying. “There are many kinds of strength, my sapling. Hunting requires strength of body, which you, for now, lack. But your level head despite your injury today shows another kind of strength, a strength of mind. I swear to you that others will envy that strength in the future.”

Sycamore was about to respond when a frantic knock came at their door.

“Yes, yes,” His mother called, making her way to the door and opening it.

Outside their house stood a young girl, Lily Aivis, a blacksmith’s daughter. She was panting, sweaty, seemed frantic. She had a jumble of dark brown hair, messy from her rush, and she wore the same linen shirt and trousers Sycamore did. Her big, brown eyes pooled tears at the corners.

“It’s my brother, Aunt Poppy,” She began in a breathless tone, “He’s – hurt.” She broke into coughs.

“Slow down, girl,” Sycamore’s mother – Aunt Poppy – said, “Catch your breath before you speak, else you’ll need healing too.”

Lily nodded and, a short moment later, continued, “My brother, he hoped to surprise our father by forging a knife while he’s out on the hunt. He misjudged the heat of the metal, burned his hands.”

Sycamore winced. He’d burned himself badly once or twice, it was intense pain, and metal from the forge was hotter than he cared to imagine.

“Right then, we best get a move on before the fool boy hurts himself worse,” She turned to Sycamore, “Come. A good chance to practice.”

He dutifully followed his mother and Lily. The young girl was hopping from foot to foot, eager for them to move faster, but his mother was not one to be rushed.

A short walk later and they came to the Aivis’ forge. Sure enough, inside was Lotus, Lily’s elder brother, sprawled on the ground with his hands held above him. Sycamore was three years Lotus’s senior. He had the same messy brown hair and teary eyes as his sister, and wore similarly styled clothes, but with a thick smithing apron on top.

“Lily,” He moaned from the ground, “is that you? Did you bring aunt Poppy?”

“Yes, I’m here, fool boy,” Sycamore’s mother said, “Now sit up so Sycamore can take a good look at you.”

Lotus tried to prop himself up without using his hands, but was unsuccessful until his sister helped him along. Sycamore walked over and crouched next to Lotus, grabbing his hand to examine the burns. It was bad. Blackened flesh on the fingertips surrounded by thick, oozing blisters. The smell, like charred meat. Sycamore bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from making a face.

“So what happened, Lotus?” His mother asked. It was a habit of hers to talk to the patient while she was healing them. Distract them from the pain and they’ll fidget less, she always said. Sycamore wasn’t skilled enough to split his focus yet.

“I wanted to-” He flinched when Sycamore poked at some of the reddened flesh, “Impress my pa. He’s out on the hunt. Wanted to show he didn’t have to worry about us while he was gone.” It was important to make sure there was nothing in the wounds that might inhibit the healing, and to check to see if there were any deeper issues. It was one thing to force the body to heal a bruise, but if that bruise was from a bone fracture and you didn’t prepare for it, setting the body’s energy on it could kill the person.

“I expect burning yourself was not part of that plan,” Sycamore’s mother said dryly.

“No,” Lotus said, “I just wanted to-“

“To make a knife, or a trinket, or a tool, or something to prove yourself a man. I’m well aware of your pride, Lotus.” She was watching Sycamore’s work over his shoulder. It was encouraging to know that if he somehow fumbled this, she would stop him before he hurt the boy.

“I’m going to start the healing now,” Sycamore said. He grabbed Lotus’s wrists and focused deeply. He sent a pulse of power through the boys arms and into his core, searching for Lotus’s essence. His mother called this the Healer’s touch, and it was a relatively uncommon ability. One of Sycamore’s few talents. After a short search he found what he sought, a pulsing well of power at the boy’s core. Sycamore used his healer’s touch to seize the edge of Lotus’s essence and pull it to the place of the burns. It was a delicate process – pull too hard or to quickly and the power would snap back to the core, restarting the process. It was like forcing jelly through a sieve. Eventually, Sycamore connected Lotus’s essence to his burns. Power surged from the boy’s core, quickly repairing any damage the burns had done. In front of Sycamore’s eyes, the harsh colors of char and blisters faded to the softer tones of recently healed skin. 

Lotus heaved a deep sigh of relief. Sycamore released the boy’s wrists and he began clenching and unclenching his hands. Sycamore was quite familiar with how itchy he must feel, “Thank you, Sycamore, Aunt Poppy. The pain is gone.”

“I hope the lesson remains, though,” Sycamore’s mother said, placing a hand on Sycamore’s shoulder, “I know you wish to impress your father, to become an adult sooner. I don’t blame you for this.” She squeezed his shoulder. “Wanting to rush to adulthood, I can forgive. Recklessness, however, is a step too far. You are young yet, and there will be time in the future for adulthood.” 

Embarassment colored Sycamore's cheeks as he considered his mother’s words. His consideration, however, was interrupted by a loud growling from his stomach.

His mother laughed lightly, “I think my son’s stomach speak for all of us. Lily, Lotus, would you like to join Sycamore and I for some afternoon snacks of dewberries and bread?”
